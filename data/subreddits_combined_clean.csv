malefashionadvice,"You're looking for high fashion designers bro. The ones that do runway shows on calendar. Heliot Emil, Acne Studios, Marni, Casablanca, Palomo Spain, Rick Owens, Echaus Latta, Diesel, DSquared2, Dries Van Noten, Vivienne Westwood, CdG, Ann D, WvB, anyone else with a acronymable name, acronym, lolol hamcus, Undercover etc. Just find the designers you like and bobs your uncle"

malefashionadvice,What this specifically is about is the campaign contribution stuff that commonly gets thrown around. While some companies may not be pro-Trump in particular a lot of their execs are very pro-Republican since they tend to be pretty pro-big business. It also gets a bit murky because a lot of the campaign contribution stuff is also the result of employee contributions and can really end up telling you nothing about the business’s actual alignment

malefashionadvice,"HLorenzo is probably the closest I’ve seen to the vague image in my head, thanks. Didn’t know that about RDJ and his stylist, so that’s cool

&gt; you probably won’t be invited. But if you’re dying for this type of experience, you could always throw your own avant-garde themed party?

Agreed that I’ll never be invited to that. My world is too formal for me to end up interacting with that world, and my peers are too conservative (nonpolitically speaking) and stiff for something like that. Not a complaint since I enjoy it plenty. Just so happen to think clothes leaning more towards “art” rather than purely function has its own intrigue. 

&gt; Both. There are loads of small designers who specialize in avant-garde

Any recommendations on how to find these “small designers”? Is it a matter of typing “indiedesigner” on IG (or whatever tag) and scroll through? I accidentally found an influencer that does minor data analysis on fashion shows, so maybe it’s just a matter of teaching the algorithm new things. Recommendations are always cool, but learning how to fish is more useful long term than getting fed one."
malefashionadvice,"I honestly think it does because I've gotten compliments on my chest and arms when I do this. Fit just means you look in good shape, so not skinny but not fat - a good amount of muscle definition. Not saying you look buff or swole.

I’ve literally never heard of it before I landed and shopkeepers were asking me if I was there for Art Basel because I had my suitcase with me. 

Back to the clothes, yes and no. At the activation event, yes. The types of outfits I saw are outside the range of my usually formal world. At the actual art exhibit? No. Sure, women were in classy dresses and men were in suits and tuxes of blues, greys, and navy, but imo that’s a traditional extension of formality. That crowd I could fit in easily with my normal closet. 

Never went to the Design district. Didn’t even know about it. My day to day fits very cleanly in the casual to formal spectrum, though I’m relatively more flexible nowadays, so it wouldn’t have done me much good to explore even if I had the time and money"
malefashionadvice,"No one is being mean to you because you are thin.

People do not treat others better because they look ""fit"" (whatever tf that even means) than skinny.

malefashionadvice,"HLorenzo has a solid selection of avant-garde / costume-y items. 

Both. There are loads of small designers who specialize in avant-garde. You just don’t really hear about them because most of what they make isn’t practical for everyday wear which equals minimal exposure. Also many celebrities have stylists who will have items made for events. For example RDJs stylist has said she buys frames, &amp; gets the colored lenses made.

Quick question in regards to shoes - I recently got a pair of [Johnston &amp; Murphy Amherst Knits](https://www.johnstonmurphy.com/amherst-knit-u-throat/02503437-105-M.html?country=US&amp;currency=USD&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMIqcTup_W7_QIVxERyCh0w6w3lEAQYASABEgLXOvD_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds). I love the look of these and, for the most part, the feel. However, that leather feature in the back is causing a bit of pressure against the back of my heel that I assume will cause blistering and has caused discomfort. The shoes fit great otherwise and are sized appropriately.

I wanted to ask if anyone else with a similar pair of shoes has experienced something like this with a new pair and if that eventual pressure from the leather will subside once it’s a little more broken in? I know the same thing happened on the lip of my Doc Marten boots but that gets a lot more pressure when walking than I assume a heel does."
malefashionadvice,"Gorpcore is a good move.

Find the good thrift store near you in a ""rich people"" town or neighborhood. (IMO this can be kind of hard in SoCal bc a lot of more affluent people out here are also ""I kNoW wHaT i HaVe!!!!"" types, but it can be done.) Go digging for good outdoor brands.

I feel like more upscale workwear brands and styles can work well here in SoCal as a stand-in for what on the East Coast would be more tailored or business-formal styles. I personally skew more Ivy/preppy but I feel like if you throw on boots and a denim jacket or chore coat you seem slightly elevated compared to athleisure."

malefashionadvice,"Rules of the Road: Texas Edition

Stop in the middle of the median to turn, block everyone, who cares.
Switch lanes under an intersection, that's definitely legal.
Never brake if the car in front of you is slowing, just switch lanes aggressively without signaling.
Lane markers are suggestions, especially for left turns, turn into their lane and play chicken.
If you can't see the driver in front's neck hair color you aren't following closely enough.
Block all intersections, you're the only driver that matters.
Red lights are a suggestion.
Yellow lights are a suggestion. 
Parking lot speed minimum is 50mph.
Waiting to turn onto the other side of the street? Don't, just go bb.
Have INTENSE road rage because YOU can't drive. 
Nobody can ever pass you or merge into your lane. Ever.
Pull into the street without looking, pancake the unfortunate souls, fun!
Take a minimum of 30 seconds to switch lanes.
Bike lanes are actually an extra car lane. 
Make the absolute thickest widest chunkiest turn possible, right into my car, bumper cars irl!

malefashionadvice,"Yeah for sure. To borrow a biology term, to me the chunky derby/loafer is almost a case of divergent evolution between the business “comfort shoe” of older corporate drones and the Doc Marten of the counterculture. 

I definitely find it interesting that the loafer or derby with a chunky practical *boot* sole is the height of fashion, but the loafer or derby with a chunky practical *sneaker* sole is considered the lamest thing ever. Personally I think they’re both ugly, but I have to concede the boot sole is less ugly. 

Ironically, the only way to truly set yourself apart from the Rockport is to go *even chunkier*! That’s the only way to really express that your chunky shoe is a fashion statement, and it is not chunky because you have the feet of a 50 year old. You can also go the other way, and get a “comfort shoe” that is stealthier than the Rockport, but at that point you aren’t really participating in the chunky trend. You’re just wearing something that looks like a traditional dress shoe (until you put it next to a pair of Allen Edmonds or Carminas)."

malefashionadvice,"The Superdry store closed down recently (but, to be honest, I've been trying to look for an alternative for a while now) and I can't quite find a jacket that looks and and feels as good as Windcheater. I think i particularly like the collar of the jacket?


I've looked at places like The North Face and their mountain jacket, but I really don't like how it feels if I'm wearing a short sleeve. I've looked at Arcteryx, but man, are they pricey. Before I look more into them I thought I would find suggestions.
Am I missing something?

First priority is that I want a jacket that looks as good as Windcheater and has a fleece interior. Hood and an interior pocket would also be great.

Second priority is that it would great if it was Gore-tex with the pit vents. I also found the ability to add another layer like The North Face jackets really nice.
Max range is maybe $300? Maybe $500?

malefashionadvice,"I think it depends on how ""smart"" your smart wear is and how casual your casual wear is.

malefashionadvice,"Off a skim, Mr Porter and END seem very traditionally formal/normal for the idea I’m imagining. Unless you had some brands in mind? Ssense and Yoox seem like they have some mix of styles. 

Obviously looking good is a goal, but so is the potential to be loud (and if everyone is loud, you fit right in). For example, a subdued outfit I saw on a guy was a bright green blazer and trousers, but instead of a normal shirt, a white fishnet/mesh shirt underneath. So there’s definitely some mixing and matching going on.

malefashionadvice,"Right, but in Canada, you expect winter and know what it's going to be like and how long it's going to last. Los Angeles typically has about 6 weeks of ""winter"", during December and January. During which it will be in the mid 50s Fahrenheit and rain approximately 3 times. 

We do not have boots. We do not have coats. We do not have enough winter clothes like flannels, sweaters, base layers, wool socks, hats, scarves, etc. to make more than a couple of outfits. And we typically don't buy that stuff in ways that are meant to hold up to heavy use. I don't spend money on winter clothes I'll wear 3-4 times a year, and which will go out of style long before they wear out.

malefashionadvice,"&gt;What do you think?

I think it doesn’t make you look buff, it just looks like you’re wearing a sweatshirt

&gt;I've been treated way nicer by people when I wear this top as compared to only wearing a simple half-sleeved T-shirt, for instance.

&gt;I strongly believe it's because I look more fit. People treat others better if they look fit, as opposed to if they look skinny or look fat.

This is in your head, you’ve decided that people treat others better if they’re fit to the point that you’ve developed an actual issue around it, you’ve found something that you think fixes that, and you’re reaffirming it to yourself while wearing it. I can guarantee this is mot happening at anywhere near a significant enough degree to go through all this trouble over, and your hypotheses, people generally do not have much of an issue with people being slightly slim, to the point of subconsciously acting on that. 

Go to therapy"
malefashionadvice,"Want to get this subs opinion. 

My first suit ever (MTM) is almost done being made. Got it for my upcoming wedding. First time I will ""officially"" wear it will be for our first look / bridal photoshoot at the end of this month. 

I, however, have a job interview coming up soon, before the shoot. This is by far going to be the most professional work place I will work in (I'll be with assisting a legal department). My SO thinks that I should wear the *new* suit to that interview to make good impressions. I am hesitant because I want the first official wear of the suit to be for our wedding. 

The alternative is a simple white button up shirt and some grey slacks. The suit is custom, mid shade of blue, and the samples I tried on that are similar looked fantastic. 

Am I wrong for wanting to keep the first wearing of the suit sentimental?"
malefashionadvice,"Sure. [This](https://imgur.com/FAYHIUC) is what it looks like. What do you think?

I purchased [this](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00JUMCPMK?psc=1&amp;ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details) base layer from Amazon and the outer layer is a thin lightweight Bella + Canvas hoodie.

It doesn't look ridiculous and I think I've stumbled onto something novel here. I've been treated way nicer by people when I wear this top as compared to only wearing a simple half-sleeved T-shirt, for instance.

The correct answer is to learn to accept that your body looks the way it does, whether you're working on changing it or not.

One idea I've tried with two layers is wearing a thick sweatshirt/t-shirt as my base layer and a thin lightweight hoodie as my outer layer.

This is nice because the outer layer is tight-fitting and it fits on top of the thicker base layer, instead of your actual body if you were to wear the hoodie by itself. This makes you look less skinny and bigger than you actually are.

I gotta say, we did a tremendous job with this road project. We really knocked it out of the park, believe me. It's the best road project in the state, maybe even in the whole country. When we started this project, people said we couldn't do it. They said it was too difficult, too expensive, too everything. But we didn't listen to them, folks. We went ahead and did it anyway, and we did it better than anyone else.

Let me tell you, we designed this road to be the most beautiful road you've ever seen. The lanes are perfectly spaced, the streetlights are gorgeous, and it's just a joy to drive on. People are gonna be coming from all over just to see this road, believe me, that's how great it is.

And we didn't just design a beautiful road, folks. We also made sure it was safe and efficient. We know how important it is to get from point A to point B without any problems, and we made sure this road would do just that. It's a road that people can feel good about driving on.

And let me tell you, we also did our part for the environment. We used sustainable materials, we implemented green infrastructure, and we even added bike lanes and pedestrian walkways. We're not just making America great again, we're making it green again too.

So I wanna thank my team, I wanna thank the great people of this state, and I wanna thank you, the judges, for recognizing our hard work and giving us this incredible award. We're gonna keep making America great again, one road at a time. Thank you very much, folks, and God bless America!"

Since our office is casual I’ve never actually seen these suits, but I tried on both brands last month and they’re definitely nice. You can see why someone who can afford it might spend that much for OTR instead of spending less for a decent custom suit. Of all the stuff I tried on that day, my favorite was a Zegna sport coat (cashmere I believe)."

malefashionadvice,"I’m not sure about when the shift occurred, but it seems likely that they’re trying to save money on the company’s end (which i find lazy) by converting to a sole closer to the outlet version of the shoe. We, at my outlet store, sell a Wallabee equivalent with a fully rubber sole. A lot of customers have, in general, noticed a slow decline in quality over the years. We get a lot of older men who are upset about the Bostonians being discontinued within the next few years. I don’t know everything as I’m only a retail worker who has been trained and has experience in shoe maintenance and construction, so don’t quote me, but I do notice that the outlet shoes are less high-quality compared to the full-price store models which we get some of occasionally. These include shoes from the Unstructured line, the Bostonians usually, and a few other models. We recently got in a model from a full-price store that is for all terrain and is pretty much Clarks’ take on a hiking/sneaker shoe for women. It’s a higher quality build than some of our other sneaker style shoes. This case with the Wallabees is most likely the company cutting corners since they know how popular their iconic best sellers are. Our outlet equivalent has a fully rubber sole, if I forgot to mention it before. They probably think they can get away with changing the sole composition since they can sell the outlet version successfully. I don’t agree with the direction the company has gone in here, and I may ask my manager about quality changes since she’s been with the company for 7+ years. 
Also, I believe the best place to complain would be someone in customer service since they deal with complaints and questions all day long, so you can ask them if there is a way to get further information on what’s happening with the iconic Wallabee’s quality. 
TLDR; the build quality seems to be shifting in the direction of the outlet version of the shoe, and the company is cutting corners. Customer service may be able to direct you to someone who will know further :)"

malefashionadvice,"I don't personally. To clarify, this isn't really a stance that I take with no background. I used to work in a specialty running store and am now a structural engineer, so I have a ton of experience in how things are manufactured and the lifecycle of shoes. Fresh foam showed a lot of promise in the Zante and Boracay days when it was first released (maybe 2014-2015 time-frame? It's been a while.)  


That being said, maybe I should say not so much that NB running is BAD as much as it's outdated, archaic, previous generation from what's going on now. Their super shoes (FuelCell Rebel) is using foam lattice that Nike had down literal years ago. In the running shoes industry, a single year behind is way behind.   


Again, to each their own. Some people may find that NB really works for them and if that's the case you should absolutely stick with what you enjoy! I don't love the company itself because i think they're behind the 8-ball and don't vibe with some of the stuff the company has gotten behind, but don't feel like you should take some stranger on the Internet's word to completely change your mind about a company. Just my opinions here."

malefashionadvice,"Is that a band collar shirt in fit 1? If so I'd wear it buttoned all the way up, it looks strange unbuttoned up top like that. You should also untuck the shirt and uncuff the pants (let them stack) and sleeves - the bunched fabric at the collar, waist, wrists, and ankles is overall giving a messy, stuffy vibe with brands whose MO is elegance and drape. I think if you make those changes fit 1 would be killer.  As for styling white pants, just think about building a nice color palette with the rest of your outfit (eg chacoal coat, heather gray sweatshirt, black shoes, or alternatively, pieces in different muted earth tones) and they'll look great. 

Fit 2 has similar problems arising from the shirt tuck, especially with the tapered sweats, it's making your hips look unnaturally bulging. It's also trying to force formality onto an outfit that will never look right being formal given the sweats. If you want to mix formality with sweats and a button-up shirt, you have to lean into making the shirt casual. See [this fit](https://www.instagram.com/p/CPqgkAgsL29/)as an example - shirt worn with a tank, sweat shorts, and Converse."

malefashionadvice,"Yeah I think it’s a valid thing to be concerned about. If you’re hanging out a bar in Bushwick and hoping to meet people, or you’re at business casual office in the suburban Midwest, those are very different situations. 

To be honest it’s a bit of a minefield, IMO. Black derbies are rising in popularity amongst the most fashionable people, but *unfashionable people never stopped wearing them.* They aren’t *that* different looking from the comfy thick-soled business shoes from companies like Rockport or Ecco or Johnston&amp;Murphy, which you will see *everywhere* if you go to an airport on a weekday (when it’s full of business travelers). Many of those business shoes will be black even with outfits where dark brown would be better. 

I’m actually not sure if that’s a good thing or a bad thing. On the one hand, maybe it’s a super power to be able to fit in with both the young hipsters and with your boss’s boss. On the other, maybe everyone else will think you’re lame. I just don’t know! 

Everything I said applies to all light colored pants worn with black shoes. The look is in right now, but it might read as too fashion-forward or fashion-ignorant depending on the observer."

malefashionadvice,"Yeah it's a genuinely hard problem. You can't expect folks who aren't familiar with clothes in general to know the pitfalls of MTM and what is/isn't a good brand, price, or timeline. 

It's unfortunate that these bottom of the barrel brands are able to dominate google search results and catch people buying stuff that they definitely don't want, but have no real way of knowing until the items arrive. 

Highlights the importance of shopping in-person. You can immediately know when something is good/bad. Which is another reason why I don't think MTM should be encouraged, especially doing it online."

malefashionadvice,"Good evening everyone,

I am honored to be here tonight to accept this award for the best roadway project in our state. I can't express how much this means to me and my team, who worked tirelessly to bring this project to fruition.

When I first embarked on designing this road, I knew that it was going to be a challenge. Our budget was tight, but we were determined to create a roadway that was safe, efficient, and aesthetically pleasing. We wanted to create a road that would connect people to their destinations in a seamless and enjoyable way.

And that's exactly what we did. We created a road that is not just a means of transportation, but an experience in itself. We designed it with the user in mind, taking into account everything from the layout of the lanes to the placement of the streetlights. We wanted to create a road that people would enjoy driving on, that would make them feel safe and comfortable, and that would make their journey more enjoyable.

But our work didn't stop there. We also wanted to create a road that would have a positive impact on the environment. We used sustainable materials, implemented green infrastructure, and incorporated bike lanes and pedestrian walkways. We wanted to create a road that would be a model for future projects, one that would inspire others to think outside the box and design roads that are not just functional, but also environmentally conscious.

And now, to stand here tonight and receive this award is truly humbling. It's a testament to the hard work and dedication of my team, as well as to the vision and commitment of our community. We have shown that even with a limited budget, we can create roads that are innovative, sustainable, and impactful.

So thank you, once again, for this incredible honor. I am truly grateful to be a part of this project, and I look forward to continuing to create roads that inspire and connect people for years to come."
malefashionadvice,Thanks. Thrift find. One of the staples of my rotation since. It’s from a house label of a big box store that was huge where I live in the 60’s. I think the tie is too long to be from a pre-80’s era but it has a very classical flair.

malefashionadvice,"I was concerned about the hipster thing actually. That’s why I asked about it being mainstream. I have nothing against hipsters but I’m just not very adventurous in the way I dress. 

And good to know they’re workable into a somewhat business casual outfit assuming you follow the normal color rules. 

One question tho about the lighter pants. I’ve been seeing a lot more guys wearing black derbies (or black Chelseas) with very light colored pants, especially white or off-white, beige, etc… I def agree it’s not mainstream but what are your thoughts on pairing them?"
malefashionadvice,"It's for running.  If you're concerned about being hit by a car then a little reflection would help with that some, (though you likely need a lot more than this).  Otherwise just get the one you like more."

malefashionadvice,"I went in-person in DC while I was on a trip there and ordered [this suit](https://i.imgur.com/8dSO8gu.jpg) as a bit of a test-run. Picked the fabric and such in-person and then did a 2nd meeting over facetime/zoom to see how that suit fit and made some adjustments. 

I talked with Roger a bit about fabrics for the wedding suit and he sent me a bunch of options in the mail to feel and see and stuff. Picked one and ordered. It happened to be a Loro Piana fabric that they stock in-bulk or something so that was finished in like 3 weeks. To save on a bit of money Roger had it shipped to his DC store first and then to me. I'm quite happy with it.

There are some details I've been exploring that HM doesn't do but most folks aren't looking for swelled edges. My general-advice take is that folks should buy RTW stuff and find a good tailor instead of going MTM. There are great MTM brands out there, but a good tailor is so much better and can make a lot more stuff work. Plus, that MTM suit really only fits you best when you got measured. You'll need someone to take in or let out the waist and all sorts of stuff throughout the life of the suit."

malefashionadvice,"Chunky black derbies are definitely super popular right now, and you’ll see them in every direction in Williamsburg/Bushwick. Worn casually by more hipster-leaning types, they go with all sorts of pants and top, with light wash jeans being the classic Wburg combo. You’ll see plenty of them worn with jeans and sweatshirts or jeans and casual button downs. Cords or chinos are common as well at this level of casualness. 

I think for more business casual wear, or for anything more dressy than jean and a casual button down, I would stick to the normal rules of matching black shoes. Meaning, wear them with black, navy, gray, and dark brown pants, but avoid them with lighter pants. I think the matching of black shoes to light pants is becoming more common but is still not mainstream."
malefashionadvice,"You're getting downvoted to hell but I agree. Have ordered two suits from them and both were absolutely fine, and I still wear them three years later. Where else can you get a heavy wool three pice suit in an unorthodox cut and style for less than 400 dollars ?"
malefashionadvice,"I've ordered two suits from them and both were fine tbh. Like sure they're not suitsupply but I also do not have 1K+ for a suit (blame me for being poor I guess). I paid less then 400 dollars for a heavy wool suit that I'm still wearing three years later. It fit perfectly and hasn't budged since, and it's miles above ready to wear suits. Shitting on hockerty because it's cheap is kinda dumb imo, it's prettty obviously basic, but serves well for the budget"

malefashionadvice,"There’s way too much going on for a newer “custom” company to pull off. Suits, separates, shoes, button downs, polos, jeans, a full list of accessories, and that’s just the men’s side. Plus they just pay for you to go to you tailor for secondary alterations, which has its limitations and removes them from any issues once that tailor touches you clothing. It’s just too much for one company to effectively handle."
malefashionadvice,"How was the ordering process for Hall Madden? Did you do an irl measuring, a try-on suit, or something else?"
malefashionadvice,"I've got a pants curse.

For the last couple of years, I've really struggled in the pants department. I've worn Levi's for a good portion of my life, but over the last couple of years I've seen a severe dip in quality and longevity of their products. I've burned through several pairs in the last year alone with the same problem- they all rip in the crotch area.

Just to answer the obvious, I do buy the right size! I've still got some room in the waist, and they don't feel too tight throughout the hips and legs.

I recently bought a couple pairs of Dickies online hoping the workwear aspect would boost the durability factor. Ordered a size up from what I normally wear as recommended and they're not even close to fitting around my waist. Since when do mens clothes have different sizes for the measurement of inches!?

I'm frustrated and at my wit's end. I'm looking for recommendations for true-to-size, slim/taper fit, long lasting pants. Help me [r/malefashionadvice](https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice), you're my only hope."
malefashionadvice,Exactly. When folks need a suit for a wedding they just need something _now_. It's not really the time to go and read the backlog of PTO and DWW and find the perfect [sincere suit](https://putthison.com/because-you-are-an-adult-you-need-a-sincere-suit/). It's time to find a half-decent RTW retailer and a replacement-level tailor.
malefashionadvice,"&gt;maybe I’m overemphasizing the impact of the weight

yes, 5-6oz is dead average for most tees unless they’re marketed as heavy, I highly doubt you can actually feel the difference between a 5 oz to a 6oz(realistically even a 7oz) to a degree that’s actually meaningful enough to bother you"
malefashionadvice,These are just about what I was looking for!! Thanks man :)
malefashionadvice,I mean they definitely do. They ordered the right size and everything presumably. They just didn't pick a good brand for it.
malefashionadvice,"I think I posted this exact comment in GD, with the addition of 20% VAT issues for EU customers undermining the value proposition once so yeah."
malefashionadvice,"People love to recommend Spier but I don't think I'd recommend then to newbies looking for a suit on a short deadline. Getting it shipped from Canada, trying it on, deciding if it does or doesn't fit, maybe exchanging/returning. Just buy like OTR somewhere that's logistically easier. Spier is great for hobbyists but I hesitate to recommend them to someone who needs a suit in short order. A 3 month lead-time would be fine though."
malefashionadvice,_My_ wedding is in April and I ordered from Hall Madden and received my suit in less than a month. I've had it for like 2 weeks now.
malefashionadvice,"Rios, Tecovas, Lucchese"
malefashionadvice,Suede loafers.
malefashionadvice,Sure but I got suits that I like from INDOCHINO I'm food for now
malefashionadvice,"Cool, yeah usually I think of Gildan as really heavy and scratchy, but I’ll take a look. I saw the Uniqlo shirts and they looked good, but I can’t find the weight. (Maybe I’m overemphasizing the impact of the weight though)."
malefashionadvice,"Gotcha, you may want to try the Gildan but I also know some folks like the boxy cut of Uniqlo U tees, you may want to give them a shot"
malefashionadvice,"The only way to tell is try stuff on. If you want that look (somewhat tight in the thighs, a little extra room in the calves) you need to find jeans that give you that same look. If your proportions are different from Elvis in his prime, you’ll need a different style of jean. Even if Elvis comes back from the dead and tells you exactly what these are, they may look totally different on you. Waist size, thigh size, and leg length (and how these things relate to one another) will all have an effect. 

Personally, I quite like the fit he has here. I would probably look for jeans that are called “straight,” “tapered straight,” “slim-straight,” “athletic,” or something like that.

Of course that is going to change a lot based on the brand. For example the straight fit might be just right on me, or it might be way too wide (especially at the bottom); the slim-straight might be just right, or it might be way too slim (especially in the thigh). The tapered or athletic is usually on the right track, but either one could be too tight or too loose in both the thigh and the ankle. 

And of course it depends on the person. If you have really big thighs compared to your waist, you might need something like a “relaxed tapered.” If you have very thin legs you might find that the slim-straight is too wide."

malefashionadvice,"&gt; Seems like bullshit to me 

Philosophically, I don't really disagree, but here we are! 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; which companies are disqualifying a candidate for wearing a suit to an interview? 

Look, I am not naming names like some rat fink stool pigeon but there are countless tech start ups and creative companies that would look at someone showing up in a suit as an extreme cultural mismatch and would count as the proverbial 2 strikes out of 3, before even sitting down for the actual interview."
malefashionadvice,"Can it replace down jackets on a cold day? I sometimes already wear a sweater under the jacket, so I suppose with a thin coat I would need an additional layer underneath it? 
Also, does a thin polyester coat have the same function?"
malefashionadvice,"Looks like the Next Level 3600 is a 4.3 oz 100% ringspun cotton tee, so only difference is a ~20% lighter weight. The Gildan G500 is 5.3 oz, if the weight is more important to you than having the same cut."
malefashionadvice,New obsession you know how it goes
malefashionadvice,"Are you mad because I said Loro Piana have a boring design team for rtw? Or are you mad because I said people only care about Loro Piana for the fabric? You could say they only care about it for the brand but thats more insulting to LP than what i originally said. Or are you mad because I said I don't think it matters as long as the fabric is Loro? 


Anyway I don't particularly care how old my jacket is because its in almost perfect condition bar a strange choice of replacement buttons, and the fabric and fit is extremely nice. 

Also why would i go into a Loro Piana boutique? Quality is excellent but the designs are uniqlo tier for menswear. If I'm buying retail designer I go to Dries dear."
malefashionadvice,"Damn, alright, that answers why even google lens couldn’t find it. Thanks for the answer. I guess I’ll have to try and find something similar then.

malefashionadvice,Thanks man! Will consider getting a pair.
malefashionadvice,"Thanks for the detailed reply, highly appreciate it! 

I tend to agree that derbies in general are too sharp for casual outfits and the black thin soled ones kind of fell in a bit of an awkward spot where they’re a bit too informal for a suit but too sharp for casual outfits so it made them a purely business casual shoe.

 And noted on the chinos, I think I get what you mean. The chinos kind of bridge the gap between the derbies and the casual sweaters instead of just looking like a place holder for black sneakers. Although I do think jeans can work if the top is a bit more formal like a button down. 

And yeah I was just looking for a good picture haha. Any recommendations on brands? I’m gonna probably buy a low priced version just to try it out but after a couple months if I like it I want to invest in a quality pair. My main thing is not getting too chunky with it, like the ones that look anything like below is too much in my opinion. Toe is too wide. I like a slight tapered look towards the toe.

Nah, Spier &amp; Mackay is the sub's go-to recommendations for inexpensive suits ($300-500), Suitsupply is often recommended too ($500-1000). For those one a tighter budget, there's a great secondhand market for suits, excellent suits can be found for $100-200 on ebay, or, if you're lucky, $20-50 at a thrift store"

Total nonsense.  Creative fields, tech, retail. etc.

malefashionadvice,"The thinner one is likely to be better for layering and will also be more versatile, since you can decide on how much stuff you need under it for any particular day. I live in a similar climate and a thin-ish wool coat works great for me from autumn till mid spring. When it's too cold I put a thick sweater under it, and on hotter days it feels and looks good with a shirt or a longsleeve tee."
malefashionadvice,"There is no relevant information, you won’t ever be overdressed wearing a suit to an interview but being undressed could be a problem.

I guess, given the wrinkles, it might be that you had this tucked in but it came undone.  That's usually a sign you could do with getting your trousers altered to fit a little better.  If they're too loose, shirts obviously untuck by themselves, but trousers that are too tight actually also cause this problem."

malefashionadvice,That's good to know! Thanks for your help!
malefashionadvice,"I'd say derbies on a chunky sole are versatile enough to wear with sweatshirts and hoodies, and overall can look interesting in semi-casual / smart-adjacent outfit. Probably go for chinos instead of jeans, and make sure the overall outfit isn't too causal, or it will look like you've destroyed your last pair of sneakers and have to wear whatever's left on your boot rack. Same goes for thin-soled derbies, they look too strict for my taste to go well with something more unconventional than a typical smart casual outfit.

You're right about derbies going mainstream, from what I've seen everyone and their mum are making this type of shoe, so try to go for a brand with good reputation, maybe the one that primarily focuses on shoes and not apparel.

Just a note on the pic you attached: the shoes themselves look decent, but feel a bit out of place with cargos and this type of jacket, but maybe my taste is too conservative.

Everything above is my personal opinion, I'm definitely not an expert in male fashion."

malefashionadvice,"Everyone else is slating them but my experience with them has been infallible. Hockerty are unfailingly excellent and I've used them many times. It sounds like you ordered a 36R for your pants but vanity sizing means that these sizings are *very* different indeed from your actual measurements. It was including both your size and measurements but ordering 36R that caused you to receive the size you got. You should only order your actual measurements *not* your regular pant size.

As for customer service, they are essentially a factory in China with a web presence. They produce fantastic quality tailored clothing at a fraction of the price you'd pay at Neiman Marcus because they don't have the cost or resources to provide that level of customer service. If you want that, you need to pay more.

You should not dispute the charge with your credit card as this would be fraudulent on your part as Hockerty did exactly what you asked them to do and provided exactly what you asked them to provide. Frankly, your issues of timing regarding your friend's wedding are a result of your poor planning. They are certainly nothing to do with Hockerty, who got the suit to you in the size you ordered within the time frame specified.

To anyone reading OPs post and thinking of avoiding Hockerty, I'd recommend the opposite. I've used Hockerty for suits and separates and they always produce extremely high quality clothing at a fraction of the price you'd pay to get it hand made in the west. Give them a try and provided you give them your actual measurements you will be delighted."

If OP essentially ordered a 36R and received a 34R, they did not receive the goods as promised at the time of purchase."

malefashionadvice,"Their measurements are correct, a decent amount of their stuff this season is a relaxed fit, so if you want that is a more slim-fit, size down (after checking the measurements)."
malefashionadvice,pretty much 100% they are Levis.  A 512 would be something similar.
malefashionadvice,Why is the vest so mission critical?
malefashionadvice,"I ‘m in a similar situation, off the shelf fits very poorly if at all. I’ve had good experience with Indochino, but that’s 100% helped by having a local store that took my measurements and done the adjustment fitting, updating their system so I can reliably order direct now.

On MFA they get some negative feedback, but my experience has been very positive for their price point"

Hi there!

The time has come for me to use my swedish graduation cap for the first time in 5-ish years. However, it looks like this:

I think the stains are from some sort of beer or something. The material is kind of like velour, and I've tried using a wet cloth to remove them but to no avail. Is this a lost cause or do you know of some way to make this less disgusting?

Thanks! &lt;3"

And despite the name, the “I’m here because I don’t know a thing about clothing and just want to look better” crowd has actually been the main focus of the sub until pretty recently, when it’s become fashion forward. The sub you’re describing is r/MaleFashion . Telling someone to avoid slim fits is pretty shitty advice unless they’re trying to become a chronically online TikTok head or they live in SoHo. Conversely, telling someone in 2015 that maybe Dior 17 cms aren’t the best investment would be good advice. “Fashion circles” aren’t the monolith you seem to be acting like they are, especially in 2023.."

malefashionadvice,"I'm looking to purchase another pair of sneakers in addition to my current black Chuck 70, but I'm not sure what color I should target to maximize my wardrobe. I'm currently going with a basic bastard look with the following pieces:

* White and light blue OCBD.
* Khaki, navy and olive green chinos.
* Dark grey wool cardigan for layering.

I was very confused by the prices on the page. Each colour of the Koio Capri costs €98 there, on the US site almost every colour costs $295.

Can anyone tell me why this is? Different quality for Europe? Currently on sale although it is not mentioned anywhere? $200 difference because of shipping and customs?"

No refunds, long delays on responses, they said their computers design them based on the measurements so there’s was no way to end up with something that looked like what they were selling.

Ended up grabbing something off of Amazon and lucked out that it fit the bill.  Thankfully we weren’t doing anything too formal."

Clearly you do not."
malefashionadvice,"So the MTM suit is a new thing for me. I wasn't searching for that kind of suit, just a color. If I could have found it premade I would have preferred that for ease and quickness. It would have been easier to just get it tailored in person.

But if I were looking for an MTM suit, yes I agree you don't search for it that way."
malefashionadvice,With a proper measuring tape I use for tracking measurements for fitness. According to the guidelines that were given.
malefashionadvice,Ok. Whatever.
malefashionadvice,"I didn't WANT an MTM suit, I wanted the color. I couldn't care less about it being MTM. And I couldn't find it in store or any other premade standard sized suit. So that was my option. I did searches for a specific color of suit, not make of suit. 

I have no problem with people offering advice or help. It's arrogant to think i couldn't benefit from any amount of it. What I have an issue with is the list of assumptions made by him without any basis and his arrogant know it all tone. I don't care how much anyone knows about any topic, if they're going to present it in a way where they're talking down to someone, they can keep their information because I'm not here to help someone stroke their ego.

I'm far from being the dick here. I literally know nothing about the MTM suit market, so if someone wants to make a suggestion for a better one to use in the future and what to look for, I'm more than happy to listen and appreciate the advice.

What he did instead is 1. Assume I had months in advance to order it. 2. Assume I didn't take proper measurements and provide them for the company, which I even said I did in the post 3. Act as though everyone has $1000 to spend on a suit, in this case even if I cared to, it would be a waste on this particular color suit for me.

Forgive me for not realizing everyone already knows they suck. I just tried to put it out there in case someone who doesn't typically buy MTM suits comes across them. And I vented a bit about the crap customer service. I see no problem with this for anyone who hasn't heard of them."
malefashionadvice,Most if not all MTM suit companies can make you a burgundy suit. You don't search a maker by the colour you want.
malefashionadvice,"Simple one, but I am looking for recommendations for a good, faded black colored t-shirt, preferably of a boxier cut. I've got a few in mind that I've found from browsing brands I know, but I'm looking to see if there are any cool minimal/essentials brands I don't know of that make stuff that's a little more grungy and forward, as I feel like there's a lot of brands I don't know."
malefashionadvice,"I definitely am hearing about this for the first time and I was pretty active on Twitter in those days. 

Looking into what happened now it looks like it was just a single executive who donated to Trump while the company itself had no other ties to him and quickly released statements distancing themselves from his campaign. Almost every major brand had at least ONE executive with Trump connections so it makes sense that it wouldn't be a top story."
malefashionadvice,You sound like a true male Karen lol No wonder customer service doesn't wanna help you
malefashionadvice,"It is strange how confident you are when you know so little. Nobody is saying you have to spend $1000 on a suit, but YOU wanted a MTM suit. It's sort of like wanting a filet and buying one from the dollar store when you could've had a really good cheeseburger. You say you had to spend time doing research but clearly, you didn't, or you're just not very good at it considering this is the result of said research.

Look, I'm sympathetic to the situation. It sucks, you're possibly out $400 and you still don't have a suit for your friend's wedding. My advice to you is to listen to what people in this thread are telling you instead of calling them wrinkly assholes because they want to help you. Most people on this sub are not wealthy or in the industry, but are just enthusiasts who like discussing and helping, of which /u/GloriousStonerHoes is a prime example. I'm not going to say I know him personally, but if there's one thing I do know, it's that he is an extremely nice and helpful user.

Listen to the advice, do better research, and in the meantime, stop being a dick, go drive to a Suitsupply, and suck it up."

malefashionadvice,"Overcoat fitting problem, should I compensate for a suit jacket?

So I tried on an overcoat at a local shop, the small size fits me well, shoulders and sleeves are at the right length, looks great, as long as I'm not wearing anything structured underneath that is. If I put my suit jacket on, there is still enough room in the chest and waist but the armhole is a bit too slim so the shoulder padding of my suit got pushed around, twisting the jacket and overall very uncomfortable. 

If I go up a size, the suit situation is more relaxed but I look baggy without the suit, longer shoulders, sleeves and wider waist. Should I go for the small one and just not wear suit jackets with it or the medium and always go with a jacket."
malefashionadvice,Literally searched for burgundy suit and this was one of the few options. It's not like I was trying to buy a black or navy suit from a random company.
malefashionadvice,"Maybe just ask since I posted it. I ordered as far in advance as I could given the 3 month notice. Would you prefer Macy's? Nordstrom? Bloomingdales? I don't care.

malefashionadvice,"&gt; Height has nothing to do with this.

Skinny people always look slim, bigger people always look bigger - clothes only change this at the very margins. People can see your size compared to objects around you and your general body shape regardless.

If it did work, literally anyone wearing any combination of layers would look bigger. Shirt+sweater=jacked! Tshirt+denim jacket=jacked! This plainly isn't true.

Do you think it's possible for the Rock to look skinny? 

Get nicer roommates next time. Your issues are not related to clothes or fashion."
malefashionadvice,"&gt; No it doesn't. Whilst clothes can have a limited effect on proportions etc and fit 'well' they are never going to change the general perception of your entire physique

If a skinny person just wears a half-sleeved T-shirt, he is going to look more noticeably skinny, than if he wore a hoodie or a sweatshirt with layers. It does change the perception of your physique.

I've personally noticed this. When I wear thin, tight-fitting hoodies, I've been called skinny more by roommates and strangers at the gym. However, when I implement the technique in the OP, I get compliments on my chest and arms because they look a bit bigger than they really are.

&gt; Short people are always short, tall always tall etc.

Height has nothing to do with this. It's about improving your frame and not looking as skinny."

malefashionadvice,"I mean this is a male fashion advice sub. If you want to model yourself after the average American corporate office that’s 10-15 years outdated instead of what’s fashionable why would you be here? That’s like saying in 2015 that one shouldn’t buy into slim since they’re dressing in baggy pleated slacks and Ecco derbies from 10 years before. Not exactly a good model for dressing well even if you’re fitting in to an outdated dress standard

Almost 0. The only way to do this properly is if you find out what exact fabric your suit is; this is often listed at better suit companies but you can try reaching out and asking customer support if it's not listed online. Then you'd have to buy the same fabric from the same mill and bring it to a bespoke tailor to make you a vest from it. You'll need to do the same with the buttons. *And even if you do all that*, there might still be batch-to-batch variation of the dyeing / fiber characteristics of the same fabric from the same mill.

malefashionadvice,"What's the best way to use clothing to make you look more fit if you are naturally skinny?

One idea I've tried with two layers is wearing a thick sweatshirt/t-shirt as my base layer and a thin lightweight hoodie as my outer layer.

This is nice because the outer layer is tight-fitting and it fits on top of the thicker base layer, instead of your actual body if you were to wear the hoodie by itself. This makes you look less skinny and bigger than you actually are. 

Before anyone asks, yes I do hit the gym and eat more, but I'm still looking to use clothing to my advantage here as I progress with the gym."

malefashionadvice,"Ah I see. Well in that case it doesn’t really matter much then, but if you have time and want to dress well/make it fun there are way better ways to do that. If you’re going to be wearing a jacket, consider something with interesting patterns, colors, or textures. For your shirt, pick a striped pattern with fun colors, or go conservative on the shirt and pick a fun tie. A lot of ways to do this that avoid the not so great dress shirt.

They're cheap MTM suits and from what I can tell, they don't do a trial fitting like other online MTM companies (e.g., Kent Wang), which is really risky and unlikely to get a good fit first try. Good MTM suits cost ~$1k, clearly there's cost cutting somewhere.

&gt; I recently ordered a suit from Hockerty for my friend's wedding and ordered with plenty of time... I needed this for a wedding by March 10th

March 10th is next week? Sounds like you did not do this with plenty of time. For MTM suits you want to order at least 3-4 months before the event to allow for making the suit + shipping + tailoring + wiggle room for any delays (such as what happened here).

&gt; I used their sizing system... the slacks are maybe two sizes two small at least

You always have to size things based on measurements of garments that fit you well. Did you provide them actual garment measurements, and they got them wrong? Or did you take a big gamble on some weird online sizing tool, and it didn't work out? Guessing it was the latter?

&gt; I sent back the slacks today and come to find out the shipping label isn't even prepaid. I had to pay $25 to send it to them.

Buyer paying return shipping is standard practice, unless you provided clothing measurements to make and they got them wrong.

&gt; The customer service rep I've been communicating with doesn't even seems to have an appreciation for the situation or any empathy other than saying that they understand and are sorry

This company makes one of the cheapest suits you can buy, it's not surprising to me that their customer service isn't stellar. But what do you want from them? They said they understand and are sorry, do you want them to grovel? 

&gt; This has been the worst experience for a $400 suit

This is like saying Taco Bell is the worst experience for a $1 burrito. 

&gt; Since they don't do refunds because they say everything is custom made, I'm going to dispute the charge with my credit card and hopefully one way or another they don't get paid for the suit

This is a dick move. Ever heard the phrase ""Poor planning on your part does not necessitate an emergency on mine""? Let their CS fix the issue.

&gt; I could have gone to the men's wearhouse and got a good suit for $500.

No.

&gt; if you're looking for a suit don't bother with them.

Yes."
malefashionadvice,I see. Contrasting vests wouldn't work here so I'll just badger them until I get answer. Thanks
malefashionadvice,Loro Piana has a division that sells fabrics to other manufacturers.  I’ve seen sellers claim an item is Loro Piana when it is just Loro Piana fabric.   Loro Piana fabric is still branded by a Loro Piana label.  Loro Piana Boutique items have a different type of label.

Adidas needs to stop messing around with their stock levels of the sambas though. I feel like they’re creating artificial scarcity to try to increase demand. And they always seem to pull all the nice color ways."
malefashionadvice,"&gt;	worst time to invest more into slim fits as you’d get the least utility from it as the trend is waning

That just isn’t really true, though, if you look past your IG explore page. I work in a business casual office in a major city and &gt;95% of people above 25 frankly dress the same way they would have 10 years ago. Clothing is still quite slim imo for people uninterested in fashion and just want to look presentable. I think it’s more likely that “slim” comes back around in fashion circles faster than “wide” catches on with most people."

malefashionadvice,"Not really, 770 is more of a slim straight. You can either go with the relaxed cut and get it tapered at your local tailor, or look for something that's specifically sold as a relaxed tapered fit ([these](https://www.cos.com/en_usd/men/menswear/trousers/product.relaxed-fit-tapered-chinos-beige.0890874015.html) are an example but not a suggestion)"

malefashionadvice,"Post a fit in the WAYWT thread. You can even crop out your face if it makes you feel more comfortable.

Having strangers tell me they liked my fit (or giving constructive feedback on how to improve) helped me feel more comfortable when trying out styles I wasn't sure about."
malefashionadvice,"This is a good question for r/goodyearwelt. Boots in the $200-400 range (e.g., Grant Stone) can be great, but ""as good as it gets"" is probably at least in the $800-1000 area (e.g., Alden). Far above that you're either paying for brand name, a specific style, or unique materials."
malefashionadvice,asket
malefashionadvice,"There’s no way to answer this properly.  The actual answer to your question (for ready-to-wear shoes) is probably around $1500 for a brand like Saint Crispins.  That’s pretty close to as good as it gets for calfskin shoes. Though you could get those same shoes in alligator and they would cost $7500+

What I think you’re asking is for a sweet spot where marginal increases in quality don’t justify the increased price. For me, that’s usually around $700-800.  However, for most of the population it’s probably around $300-400. Most people won’t notice much difference beyond Grant Stone quality until they become true shoe nerds."

malefashionadvice,"Which websites should I check out for buying affordable clothes that also fit well, for thin guys?"
malefashionadvice,"I would agree with Leviathan. The suit and the gray tie are a good color match, but I am not a fan of the plain tie with shiny texture. Something with a pattern or texture but less shiny will be seen as more stylish and/or more professional by most people, IMO. Even something simple like a grenadine tie in the same solid color would be nice."
malefashionadvice,"Ok, I see the issue. The colors are fine but the satin material of your tie is giving it a luster that is likely throwing you off. I'm partial to ties like [this](https://www.kentwang.com/accessories/ties/grenadine-navy.html) or [this](https://www.kentwang.com/accessories/ties/wool-donegal-navy.html) that have some texture to them. The [model photo](https://www.kentwang.com/media/catalog/product/cache/76365af441ea129bbed454bf05fc598f/5/1/51169087441_ac205aa23f_o.jpg) of the former shows it looking nice with a gray suit. If you have time before your shoot to get a better navy tie, I would suggest that. If you don't have time, honestly, you look just fine in the gray suit."
malefashionadvice,What is the price range for boots where it’s as good as it gets? Without it relying on the branding to get there.
malefashionadvice,"&gt; relatively speaking, I have little to be anxious about.

You only experience your life, so you shouldn't compare your anxiety to what I had to get over. Your feelings about your own clothes and situation are totally valid. 

&gt; I guess what I'm saying is, my style is 'out of time'.

Without seeing it, maybe it is, but if that's what you like and want to wear then keep at it. I was just saying that as you wear some combinations more regularly, they'll seem less daunting - I think that's called habituation. I meant it as encouragement."
malefashionadvice,"Yeah it's tough to size and I really recommend finding where you can try some on.

For Chambords, I got a size 43. They have a full set of laces so you have some wiggle room. They're sized like boots so if you have wide feet like me, they will work without you having to size up (as I do in athletic shoes).

I have the Michaels in size 44 and they're a bit too big (UK 9.5 is how I saw them listed). I think the main problem is that the laces don't give many options for tightening up. I only wear them with thick socks.

Probably Michaels in size 43 would fit me better so maybe sizing is the same for both? Just keep the laces in mind if you find yourself taking a leap of faith."
malefashionadvice,"Ok, I don't really know what you mean by ""I feel like she is testing me."" 

To revise my original reply to you, it's a high school prom so the typical fashion rules are pretty much out the window. [Do it if you must.](https://www.amazon.com/Cheetah-Leopard-Bowtie-Polyester-Pre-tied/dp/B01BMJC4RY)

If you want to stick to something that's more ""menswear approved"" then keep the tie simple and go with a pocket square that looks congruous with a leopard print without exactly matching it. Something like [this](https://www.kentwang.com/accessories/pocket-squares/shah-jahan-shamsa.html) or [this](https://www.kentwang.com/accessories/pocket-squares/peacock-spreading-its-tail-feathers.html) (these are just ideas and you're obviously not expected to spend $45 on a pocket square as a high schooler)."
malefashionadvice,"How much time do you have before the photos?  Solid shiny satin ties pretty much always look bad. Your suits look great and the tie is ruining the fit. If you have time, go buy a better tie."
malefashionadvice,"Thanks.  Lol. So what's the best way to get a suit with good material  that i can have a local tailor adjust.   

The matching shirt and pants looks awesome btw.  I'll share pictures of past suits later."
malefashionadvice,More slim than straight?  501’s are the OG.  Perhaps they’re the true “straight” and your just looking for jeans that are straight loose fit (slightly baggier / looser). 😁
malefashionadvice,"eh, good point."
malefashionadvice,"That's what I was thinking but the leopard print she has is super weird. It is very small and the inside of the dots are filled with a lighter shade of black, while the dress color is your rather normal leopard color but metallic."

malefashionadvice,"Loro Piana is both a brand and a mill.  So they make their own clothes (typically with their own fabrics). And they also sell their fabrics to other brands. 

If you just see a “Loro Piana” tag (typically a brown background) then it’s probably the brand.   These clothes are typically very high end. 

If you see “Ing Loro Piana” with some description of the fabric then it’s just the fabric from the Loro Piana mill.  It might be high end or it might be mall tier."

malefashionadvice,Lmao
malefashionadvice,"This entire idea sounds like a nightmare.   Italian wool is a meaningless marketing term. Just because it comes from Italy doesn’t mean it’s good. It’s like saying “American food”. It could be Alinea or it could be Arby’s. 

You mention having a shirt made with the same material as your suit.  This sounds like a bad idea. 


If you’re still set on proceeding with this bad idea then just measure your best fitting suit and give those measurements to the maker. Make sure to tell them they are the suit measurements, not your body measurements. Good luck.  There’s still time to not do it."

malefashionadvice,"Headphones and angry resting face will do it. And if you’re going all black well, then it shouldn’t have any of the dangerous connotations I mentioned earlier. 

Even within the realm of “all black done well” there are differences that might make an outfit more intimidating. Bomber vs cardigan, metal/punk tee shirt vs plain, combat boots vs shoes, ripped black jeans vs clean, black beanie/hat vs not wearing a hat. Add all of those up and they make a difference, though probably less than adding smile or taking off the headphones!"

malefashionadvice,"I have a photo session for my company website profile, and I want to wear a gray suit, (navy is my backup) but the tie that I like (blue with high hue and saturation) looks really bad together.  Other shades of blue somewhat works, but none of them looks well put together. I'm wearing a white dress shirt. I don't understand how these safe colors just don't work together. Any advice?

As a side note, it's a conservative firm, and they have strict restrictions for the photo shoot:

1. The attire has to look seasonally neutral
2. **No bright red, pink, bright green, yellow, orange, or colors on the warm side of the spectrum.**
3. No stripes, checks, plaids, or patterns on the shirt or jacket.
4. Dress shirt must be a white or light-colored solid shirt under a dark jacket.

There is no mention of restrictions on tie color except #2, which applies to the entire attire. If nothing works, I think my navy suit with a dark blue tie works well, but I strongly prefer to make the gray suit work if possible. I always used to pair this with some bright or warm colors, so #2 is throwing me off.

tl;dr: What are some non-bright colors that go well with a gray suit?"

malefashionadvice,"What did you generally wear pre-pandemic, assuming it was also a biz cazh kind of workplace? I would take that and go one better."
malefashionadvice,This exactly. Don’t use my $500 as a guide. I just am spendy if I consider it to be a good value.
malefashionadvice,"Just another day at work for the rep, they've definitely had worse lol"
malefashionadvice,Great recommendations. I like the made in US also.
malefashionadvice,I enjoy Narragansett Leathers for casual belts. I've heard good things about Popov leather belts on MFA but I don't have personal experience with them. Both are significantly under your placeholder budget
malefashionadvice,"

I think an all-rounder is a good choice. Imo comfort &gt; performance. Your feet will feel better, and it's better for improving your footwork. I have Solutions, but Mythos are my gym shoes and they feel great even on roofs. 

For gym bouldering, you want lots of rubber on your heel/toe for hooks. Tenaya's Balance last could be the upgrade for you. Helix and Mythos are also comfy neutral shoes."
malefashionadvice,"You will find luxury belts at that range. But luxury brands do not exclusively sell quality belts. You can find quality belts for much less. The reason why I put $500 as a placeholder was because I do not discriminate between luxury or regular brands. I will buy for pretty low if it’s quality. I will buy for higher than $500 if it’s quality as well and if others consider it to be a good value. I just want quality, luxury brand or not. I consider billy Kirk to be top tier, which costs $100-$150, in case you’re interested. I own one and it’s pretty good. I myself am just looking for other brands recommended by redditors."
malefashionadvice,You can get great belts for $50-150. Most belts above that price range you're paying for brand name
malefashionadvice,"They’re cemented construction and can’t be resoled once they start to fall apart. If you want a pair of Chelsea boots, get some made with Goodyear welt construction. Thursday is an okay brand for entry. More info in the r/goodyearwelt sub (Though be aware that people can be snobs/connoisseurs depending on your POV.) Meermin and Becket Simonon also bandied about as better lower-cost options. Go to the sub to learn more than I know."

malefashionadvice,"You’re amazing, thank you so much for all the feedback!"
malefashionadvice,Grip6 or any decent leather belt from your local leatherworker. You don't need $500 for a business casual belt or any non-fashion belt really.

malefashionadvice,This outfit is better cuz it already has contrast. A brown belt would be better but that's a subtle difference
malefashionadvice,"&gt; I don’t think I have long arms, the jacket is a size 36r and I’m 5’9’’, I was afraid it might be a little long tbh

Gotcha. I think the length is good for you. 

&gt; Thoughts on green pants?

Those are also dark, like the gray ones you initially posted, and even closer in color to the brown - handsome pants but not a good combo with the jacket. You need something that's lighter in tone, like [these](https://www.walkerslater.com/edward-trouser-cw-brkn-hb) or [these](https://www.walkerslater.com/edward-trouser-lw-fwn-tw-dn) or [these](https://www.walkerslater.com/james-trouser-grey-shetland-herringbone-birdseye-vintage-tweed). Maybe [these](https://www.walkerslater.com/edward-trs-cw-hb-grey) if there's enough contrast (hard to tell from website pics how they'll look in person next to the brown. it would probably work.)"
malefashionadvice,"Yep, any of them would work better imo"

malefashionadvice,"Thank you!  I don’t think I have long arms,  the jacket is a size 36r and I’m 5’9’’, I was afraid it might be a little long tbh. There is a little padding that sticks out past the shoulder.  That was one of the main things I was concerned about, I’ll look into having the pads removed, thanks for the idea. 

The pants don’t feel particularly uncomfortable, I’m probably not used to wearing dress pants and they’re a size smaller than my normal jean size.  Thanks for the feedback on the color, I think you’re right.  They do blend together a little bit.  Unfortunately, the company that I bought the jacket from is out of the matching pants in my size, but you gave me a lot of great options that I hadn’t considered.

malefashionadvice,What are some good belts? I’d like to pair them in a business casual setting. Any recommendations or advice would be greatly appreciated. I don’t have a budget but I’ll set it at $500 as a placeholder. But you can recommend me something higher if you think it’s really worth it. I’m not looking for a showy belt with gaudy logos like Gucci. I just want an unassuming belt. Let me know. Thank you redditors
malefashionadvice,"Thanks! I didn't see the guide, but was looking in the wrong spot."
malefashionadvice,"The one area where being obsessive about shoe fit is actually useful 

I’m working with the Tenaya Tanta as an intro shoe since my gym sells those. Thinking to upgrade to Solution or Drago eventually. But the nicer Tenayas like the Oasi or Mundaka or Indalo are both comfy and narrow-footed which is good for me. They seem to be more all-rounders rather than specialist shoes. Any thoughts?"
malefashionadvice,you bought a new pair of new balance every 1.6 months?
malefashionadvice,"I wish my throwback fashion sense wasn't so standout...like it was just accepted, like we accept fashions we see on TV programs and the movies. I know they're often theme-based, but like I say, I wish it was as easy for me to go practically unnoticed in that sense. I also know that much of the anxiety I have around it is purely just 'in my head', but you know...the head's not going anywhere, and 'just rock it!' is a concept easier said than done. I just don't like anything else...my style's for life."
malefashionadvice,A report would be great! Thanks for the recommendations

anyone know what this type of jacket is called or the brand of any similar one?"
malefashionadvice,He belong to ivy streets now
malefashionadvice,Hell yeah! Let me know if you want shoe tips or recs
malefashionadvice,He Ivy style now
malefashionadvice,"The jacket fit generally seems good. At first glance I thought it was short via the [rule of thumb](https://putthison.com/the-rule-of-thumb-theres-a-rule-of-thumb/) but the hem is about halfway between the collar and the floor, which is correct - do you have long arms? if so, I think the rule of thumb doesn't apply to you.

In picture 3, the shoulders do seem possibly too padded for you. Can you feel any padding sticking out past the end of your shoulder? It's not really a big deal, and it really looks fine still, but, if you prefer a less padded look, I recently had the shoulder pads removed from a tweed herringbone jacket and [I quite like the result](https://i.imgur.com/vRMtEJC.jpg).

I don't think there's enough contrast between the colors of your jacket and your trousers - when wearing a dark brown jacket, you want mid gray or light gray trousers like [this](https://putthison.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/tumblr_m81y8qYfAy1qa2j8co4_500.jpg), or, if you want charcoal trousers, a mid or light brown sport coat like [this](https://putthison.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/tumblr_m81y8qYfAy1qa2j8co9_500.jpg). If there's not enough contrast, it looks like an ""almost suit"" which you don't want. 

Your trousers don't look too tight to me - do they feel uncomfortable? 

With this outfit you'll want a white or light blue shirt, a dark tie, and if you like pocket squares it's hard to go wrong with a simple white one with in a tv / presidential fold."

malefashionadvice,Too small.
malefashionadvice,"Thanks a million! I did ask what they thought of when buying but they said they didn't really have an idea, they just thought the colors were nice and the price was good.

malefashionadvice,"Watchmen remains a masterpiece despite the fact that a huge percentage of the fans think Rorschach is a role-model. The same thing goes for Fight Club and Tyler Durden, Breaking Bad and Heisenberg / WW, or Wall Street and Gordon Gekko. 

Idiots misreading narrative is not an indictment of the quality of said narrative, but of the lack of media literacy and general intelligence of the audience. 

Malcolm Gladwell calls it the “satire paradox” and discusses it at length on his podcast. Despite the fact that the man has been wrong about a few things in the past (who hasn’t?), it's worth a listen

malefashionadvice,"They size down to even XS (which I find unusual) and with current trends jackets are cut a whole lot shorter than they were 10 years ago. Uniqlo has easy returns so I think it'd be worth a shot. I'm sorry but I'm not sure which particular jacket I own from them (I have more than one blazer, but my son stole one of them). The one I use is unlined, feels wool-like, and while it has patch pockets (which I typically don't care for) the overall look is much dressier than I expected (and that I like with this jacket), and maybe a lot of that has to do with the slim fit, it looks tailored."

malefashionadvice,"Same exact dimensions here.  And it is a struggle. I find that tall sizes are always way too long, especially in the arms.  I have had better luck just finding brands whose regular sizes run a bit longer but it definitely limits your options.

Next Level t-shirts are incredible and only $10 on amazon.  I highly recommend the sueded crew (the best) and the 6210 (a close second).  Fit great. Long but not too long.  I would hang dry to retain the fit.

I find j crew slim oxfords in large fit well though the sizing varies a bit from order to order.  Some fit great others are too tight/short which is frustrating. There crew neck sweatshirts in large also fit well though i had to shrink that in the dryer for a good fit.

I hope others chime in her as well though."

Could always go a tad more formal and opt for a full navy or gray suit. Adding a tie/bowtie wouldn't be necessary for a 'casual' wedding, but you'd rather be overdressed if anything.

'Fall colors' is a bit broad. For blazers/suits, navy and gray are your best bets. If you're feeling ambitious, a brown or even burgundy blazer/suit could look good if you find the right shade.

Otherwise  stick to gray, navy, or beige pants, depending on your blazer color."

Going by her [Insta] (https://www.instagram.com/wongk/?hl=en) I think she's really good at getting proportions in differing top and bottom shapes to create a balanced silhouette.

And shout out to the double ""denim"" (chambray counts, imo) with contrast in [this look] (https://www.instagram.com/p/CMgxnLgnUSw/?hl=en), I think it absolutely nails all the hard parts of balancing width of fit and tonality."

My options are: 

(1) Keep the size 8.5 and hope it breaks in to become more comfortable.

(2) Keep the size 9 and maybe add a heel insert/sizer/liner/whatever those things are called.

(3) Return both and look elsewhere for minimal white sneakers with a slightly wider toebox.

malefashionadvice,Have you seen the Tiago 1010s or New balance 306? They have an insanely wide range of sneakers
malefashionadvice,"Hi I have been reading these and at this point I’m just picking a random one of yours to finally respond to.

LP is “boring” in the sense that the designs and overall attitude is geared towards timeless luxury and/or “silent wealth”. The original comment was a bit of a meme but also a bit of truth, and I have to say if you sell their suits you do a very poor job changing this representation.

The fabrics you linked are boring in that they are nice and definitely a bit fun relative to other designs, but it’s not just about that. The silhouettes LP goes for are not daring; there is nothing immediately fashion forward about LP in choice of design when compared to vendors like Peter Millar, David Donahue, Ted Baker. Those vendors all combine unique textiles with contemporary silhouettes—it’s not that LP *can’t* do this or won’t but rather that they just don’t because of their appeal to a more sophisticated and less trendy market.

But what this results in are rather boring cuts of nice fabrics which function ultimately as subtlety pieces for wealth expression rather than comfort or even textile composition at a certain point. If you dress people on suits you already know this. LP’s schpiel, which this article is correct to discuss, is in appealing to people like Larry David or Zuckerberg who will wear outlandishly expensive and lavish versions of basic goods without any branding or any kind of marker that it’s luxury.

Additionally, your overall attitude frankly just sucks. I don’t know who you put in suits but if you can’t accept that people have a different opinion of fabrics—to the extent that you’re barking down several people and trying to control their opinion—you may not have the client’s best interest in mind anyway. My favorite among the swatches you provided is the burgundy, but even then I have seen just as exciting textile patterns used by Banana Republic.

LP makes a living by not getting a rise out of their customers; you trying to foment one in order to bolster LP as some innovative Paris-walk of a company in order to change our minds is, I’d say, counter to their ethos."

Of course I don't speak for anyone else, but my girlfriend is unimpressed when I wear conventional, ""boring"" clothes. My style has gotten significantly more daring since I started dating her - in large part because of her encouragement. She loves long, loose, avant-garde pieces most. I don't dress for her; she's just given me the confidence to try things I would've been on the fence about before.

I doubt most people could tell these apart from normal Stans. That is to say, if you like Stans they are a fine option.  Chalk vs Cloud is a distinction without a difference. There is no outfit that  one will work in where the other won't. They are both white sneakers."

Succession perfectly fits into that definition, you're still confused about the difference between *doing something* and *doing something well*.

I'm not trying to be ""good vibes,"" I'm trying to give you practical advice: this doesn't matter. When's the last time you've seen someone else and thought they had a weird torso-to-leg-length ratio? Hopefully never? People come in DQs all the time concerned about some weird body insecurity (arms too long, legs too big, shoulders too narrow, head too big) and they all look completely fine.

&gt; I live in a tropical country so suit jackets/sport coats do not really fit haha.

Linen, tropical wool, and fresco are more breathable materials that are better suited for hot/humid climates.

&gt; Do people wear suspenders under their Tshirts? Like already on their skin?

No, suspenders are only for wearing under suit/tux jackets and sport coats. 

Unfortunately, I don't have any advice for how to handle pants falling down even with a belt in a situation where you can't wear suspenders. Higher waisted pants are worth a try. If you're wearing casual outfits, maybe try drawstring / elasticized waists?"

malefashionadvice,"Counterpoint: 12 is dope as fuck. Low contrast is harder to pull off, but obviously not impossible. 

I'd also argue that 6 suffers more from the silhouette not being aligned - the shirt is a closer fit than the pants in a way that makes it look unbalanced to me (and if I'm nit picking: the belt should be closer in tone/shade to the shoes, which would give it a little more colour continuity and more importantly create a stronger top/bottom bifurcation in a way that would bring out differences in fading and tone between the shirt and pants)."

malefashionadvice,"**Satire:** *A* [*genre*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genre) *of the* [*visual*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_arts)*,* [*literary*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature)*, and* [*performing arts*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performing_art)*, usually in the form of* [*fiction*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiction) *and less frequently* [*non-fiction*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonfiction)*, in which vices, follies, abuses, and shortcomings are held up to ridicule, often with the intent of shaming or exposing the perceived flaws of individuals, corporations, government, or society itself into improvement.* (per [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satire))

There's an actual definition. Now, if something is being ridiculed or shamed, is it fair to say that people observing the ridiculing or shaming should not want to emulate the thing being ridiculed or shamed? Or put it another way, is something actually being shamed or ridiculed if it becomes a fucking style icon?

How much shame can the target of this alleged satire actually be under if people watching the ridiculing think ""this is sooooo cool, I want to be these guys!"" Seriously, stop taking the author's claim at face value, take a step back, and actually *think* about what words mean and how they are used. Consider a work not on its claims, but on its merits. 

Can something be said to be ridiculed if the ridiculing makes it more popular and appealing?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; The use of irony and ridicule does not need to be heavy handed to qualify. 

Wait, you actually think *Succession* is subtle? Seriously? Holy shit, dude, read a book or something. 

Not sure why you bothered bringing irony into things, except that it reinforces my suspicions that people who believe *Succession* is good satire are not terribly well-read and don't have a good understanding of literary and artistic terminology."

Suspenders should never be seen, they're meant to be hidden by a suit jacket / sport coat.

malefashionadvice,"This is such a personal opinion and Nuanced  question, because everyone’s preferences are so different. In all honesty, walking in stiffer shoes might be ideal for you if you have a need for stability or support. It’s like a bed, some people like soft beds some like them firm. I personably love a Nike Pegasus for walking/hiking. Saucony is great for more support and stiffness. On clouds are nice for responsiveness but I find they don’t last very long and wear out quickly, plus are pretty expensive for what they are. Hoka is a lot of vision but not a lot of support and a huge stack height so they’re unstable in my opinion. 

All of these have options in the supinate and pronation categories (neutral stride/supportive stride), so can’t recommend a specific one without knowing your case. Highly recommend just getting fit at a shoe store once and then buying them online. It’s also frustrating because many shoes change drastically between model years so even at best it can still be a struggle finding shoes you like year to year.

malefashionadvice,"Here's the definitive guide to whether something is satire or not: if people, after consuming the work, are eager to emulate or become the thing being ""satirized,"" it is not a satire. Or, at most, it's failed to accomplish it's goal.

Given that we are having this conversation under an article from GQ about how everyone suddenly wants LP because Succession made it popular and people want to emulate the characters of Succession, I would say that the show has failed miserably.

Contrast this with Silicon Valley, the definitive television satire of the last few years: no one wants to be Richard or Dinesh or Gavin Belson. They might see themselves in the characters, but they don't aspire to ensure them.

&gt;then some of it may have gone over your head.

malefashionadvice,"My understanding has always been that they're primarily a fabric supplier for other brands, and they're known for the quality of their wools and cashmere. They'd also occasionally make limited runs of fairly basic items with their own tag. Seeing it touted as it's own stand-alone brand is kind of weird to me. I guess I'm just not up to date with this kind of thing."
malefashionadvice,"Yeah, something like a cardigan I imagine would have the same level of comfort. I would he concerned a light jacket wouldn't be comfortable to wear around the house, I don't much like feeling restricted.

I know hoodies can be fashionable, but something a little more classic is the goal.

Thanks for asking for clarification. I'm not well versed in this stuff."
malefashionadvice,It’s a throat latch( when you fully button it up you can button the latch onto another button on the other side of the collar for more wind protection
malefashionadvice,"Yes. It’s to secure here both sides of the collar together when you have it flipped up and the coat is buttoned all the way up. You should see the button on the other side of the collar from the strap, to secure the strap to."

There's a little bit of leniency in the industry  i work so even black nikes can be suggested."

Hello everyone,

im a bigger guy(220pound) from Berlin, Germany and im looking for durable fashion in europe. A nice member from [r/BuyItForLife](https://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/) redirected me to you.

**What I need**: Jeans Socks Shoes

**Usecase**: everyday Clothing for Officetime(no Dresscode), going around the city and meeting friends/family

**Budget**: I work for almost minimum salary but im willing to spend a hundred Schmeckels when I can get quality that last for years.

Im  always just buying the cheapest stuff that seems to fit. But i hate  that its breaks down so fast. I want durable Stuff for a decent Budget  in europe maybe directly in germany.

I  dont care for Brands/Labels, because it was never a thing in our  family. The only time I buy something new is, when there is literally  not a single item in my closet with out a hole. That makes for maybe 2-3  items new per year. Everyone i meet says im dressed decently and there  is nothing wrong with my choice. But i never see something in the mall  or when out with friends and think ""thats nice i want to buy that"", it  just isnt in my mind.

Thanks to everyone for reading and for support. Sorry for my bad english."
malefashionadvice,Anyone have any recommendations about those machine-washable suits I see advertised? Anyone have any good experiences?
malefashionadvice,"Can you be a bit more specific with what you’re looking for, hoodies can still be fashionable. Maybe some kind of cardigan or light jacket?"
malefashionadvice,it’s a plain black t shirt you can wear it with anything casual. I dislike black and beige but besides that like any color or style of pants is fine
malefashionadvice,"I kinda get it if one is a some kind of smart fitness tracker or similar and the other is a regular watch. Still don't think it looks great but at least I understand it.

malefashionadvice," Hi there,

New here, and I'm needing advice pairing a t-shirt with appropriate trousers.

I'm  looking at the below t-shirt, Doc Martens 1461 shoes on the bottom, but  I can't figure out what kind of trousers I should be wearing. The  picture shows some white jeans/chinos, though I'm thinking it may be a  bit garish for myself.

Does anyone have advice when pairing a darker top with appropriate trousers that also complement the shoes?

Should  I be looking at chinos, jeans, dress, something twill? Plain, checks,  another thing? Hope this is in the right place and thanks :)

malefashionadvice,I don’t think I’ll ever understand why people who don’t like double denim.
malefashionadvice,"The styles keep moving. This album is a couple years old, so it’s more of a starting point than a destination. It’s much easier to label the looks that have a strong, singular point of view. “Prep” and “gorp” are both relatively descriptive, but when you try to describe a look that draws from both influences, you end up with a paragraph rather than a one liner. It’s probably easiest to find the middle by looking to different aesthetics and then finding the overlap."

malefashionadvice,"Hey you two, thanks for this dialogue. I’m in my 40s and I’ve never been into fashion - the “nice” brands that make stuff in my size is basically Ralph Lauren, Peter Millar, and not much else, so that’s basically what’s in my closet. I had to Google OCBD just now, and whoever Teddy Santis is, is still lost on me - but that picture of him trying to decide on shoes is hilariously close to what I do every day….

At any rate, this exchange was really interesting and eye-opening and a peek into a world that I never really cared about and never understood why others did - but I think I have a better grasp on why people care about this stuff. I probably never will, but that’s not a value judgment, either. Genuinely fascinating thanks for the good questions and the good answers."

malefashionadvice,"I got the joke! It was a fine and funny joke, but I think their fabric AND designs are nice.

I mentioned that I wasn't even aware they retailed their clothes under their own brand. I was referring to the mills they use, designs they create, etc sold under different brands, like the ones I sell."
malefashionadvice,"So,  I'm a bigger guy. I get my suits made at a tailor so they fit better,  but as far as other clothes, what brands work best for a fat pig such as  myself?

I was in Vegas and the  Italian brands don't like men like me. Now, I did find a nice shirt at  the Armani store, size 60, that was a looser fit, but most of the  Italian clothes are tighter fitting.

I bought a Patagonia hoodie. XXL my ass. Same with a Robert Graham shirt I bought.

What  nicer clothing brands should I look at that will fit me better. I'm  pear-shaped. And yes, I am working on losing weight. I've lost 30 pounds  and still going."
malefashionadvice,It's just misplaced in context. You've responded to a meme joke about the clothing designs as if it was criticizing the fabric. The cloth they produce is not their clothing designs for sad children.
malefashionadvice,Yeah but something casual and unstructured like [this](https://www.ssense.com/en-us/men/product/engineered-garments/black-bedford-jacket/10483531?gclid=Cj0KCQiA6fafBhC1ARIsAIJjL8mjqfcPQcXo3VfHsO11blZS_gIjksVj1ZTJOgPVuWS2UGVsfA0fhM8aAuDmEALw_wcB)

malefashionadvice,"I think I had a similar experience because I wore camo a bunch as a kid and I moved towards more traditional colors and patterns since then. I thought it would be fun to experiment with something new but I forgot to think about how most people would perceive it. I’m pretty oblivious sometimes so I appreciate the feedback!

I have also noticed that green and tan are pretty safe colors to wear and they can be incorporated into most outfits. I was looking at [this smock/jacket](https://www.asmc.com/leo-koehler-bw-ksk-smock-olive) and they have a version in olive green and that desert camo. I pretty certain that the green version would be a better option."
malefashionadvice,It was -1 when I commented that but I take your point. Anon trolls be anon.

malefashionadvice,"Looking for a company that sells good, durable linen long-sleeve t-shirts that can be used for blue collar work.   
I personally really like the rolled up sleeve farmer/cowboy aesthetic, and I actually do spend a lot of time in the woods or mucking out barns or doing carpentry. It seems like a lot of the easier to find linen companies are more casual wear.

malefashionadvice,"Seems right up your alley tbh. Canvas doubleknees, cord hats, thiccc OCBDs, flannel over shirts, and fleece jackets *made from actual wool fleece* sold 5-6 years before the big vintage fleece revival."
malefashionadvice,"A tux is more extroverted than a suit, especially if worn at a black tie optional event where a lot of people are wearing suits. A dinner jacket in any color other than black is way more extroverted than black. My only black tie jacket is a black velvet dinner jacket, and even with every other part of the outfit being traditional, it definitely is noticed.

Skinny ties would be more extroverted and younger, but I think they are starting to become less common and look more dated. Which actually might make them more extroverted, like the skinny suits. And yeah no one is wearing truly wide ties (average ties are now what the Pitti types are mostly wearing) unless they’ve been wearing them since the 70s. 

Double breasted suits are classic, but they are uncommon. It’s extroverted to wear something that is uncommon, especially when it changes the whole silhouette. The same would apply to vests worn with a suit — classic but uncommon. 

Yeah a pocket watch is definitely extroverted, but not as much as other things mentioned. I do think it’s one of those extroverted-nerd things, like the bow tie or fedora or a vest worn without a jacket (the pocket watch is definitely the most subtle of those)."
malefashionadvice,Their skate division has some nice shoes. Even have vans slip-ons equivalents.
malefashionadvice,Interesting to see people on the male fashion subreddit be so incredibly out of touch with what’s going on in the world of sneakers. My friends who know nothing about fashion also think that NB is just grandma sneakers.

These questions are veering into nonsense-land."

malefashionadvice,"Thanks, that's a very good insight. 

What do you think of tuxedos vs regular suits?

&gt;Neckties with a suit are too mainstream to 

Good point. Maybe in that case the color/pattern matters more, I suppose. Even width: I consider the wide ones to be more corporate and for oldies, while skinny ties are more younger. (at least to me, wonder if others see it that way?)

&gt;double-breasted suits

Hmm I view classic double-breasted suits (with muted colors) to be a sort of English gentleman dress, and I mean that in a more introverted way. Granted it's not really a thing with American and Italian style suits.

&gt;suits other than gray, navy, and muted brown

And suits that aren't floral. Especially with the sockless trend, looks really extroverted. As for accessory, I think a pocket watch is suitable for both."
malefashionadvice,"Yeah for sure. I should add, my dad collects military uniforms, and has a treasure trove of stuff going back to the 1800s. I’ve appreciated it my whole life and worn it in public my whole life, but I definitely took some biiiiiiig steps away from it when I became more socially and culturally aware in high school and college."
malefashionadvice,And a homer cockring downstairs!
malefashionadvice,I had a similar thought process because I live in a liberal area and I haven’t been to a gun range since I was a kid. I should definitely be more aware about when and where I could wear it because in most places it would look out of place.
malefashionadvice,"I’ll check it out. It’s good to hear that space is still going. It really was a pretty cool experience to stumble upon that old sign, think it was an actual abandoned liquor store, and then discover it was full of cool shit. 

Did you ever make it to Best Made, before the store closed and the brand sold out? That was the coolest store in NYC when it was still open, IMO."

malefashionadvice,Back in high school in the mid-late 80s we’d wear two Swatches and sometimes two shirts with both collars up. I wish I was kidding.
malefashionadvice,"Yeah, it's a good general guide that's helpful for most people. You'll run into issues if you have olive skin, because then the warm-cool dynamic goes off the rails - olive skin can look good in both gold and silver, but you'll find a lot of colours that should suit you make you look tired or ashy. And then some colours that shouldn't suit you, look great. Also if you're heavily pigmented or unpigmented - think people with albinism, or people who have very deep black skin - you'll find that most colours will suit you because most colours visually work on deep black or stark white, even if these are on humans of that tone. So it's hard to tell someone with deep black skin that they're a winter when they'll still look very fascinating in pastels, and brights, and warm neutrals.

But that's only some people. I'm only commenting this because someone may read your comment and think it's a panacea, when it still has some kinks to work out."
malefashionadvice,"Bow ties (unless they are black bow ties worn with a tux) are often considered nerdy, but it is most definitely an extroverted nerdiness; your quiet unassuming nerds definitely aren’t wearing them. There is definitely some overlap between bow tie wearers and fedora wearers (though the bow tie is not nearly as bad). There are also often strong Tucker Carlson and/or Young Republican vibes. 

Neckties with a suit are too mainstream to have any particular association. Neckties with sweaters and cardigans can be cool, but old fashioned. Neckties with just a shirt are the height of corporate lameness, a uniform only worn by those who are required to wear it. The cool guys would rather wear a jacket with no tie than a tie with no jacket. Neckties with a short sleeve shirt are only for door-to-door missionaries. 

There is a whole list of things that tend to be associated with 1930s mobsters and/or Gordon Gecko: double-breasted suits, big lapels, big shoulder pads, pinstripes, contrasting shirt collars, French cuffs. Other than the French cuff, which is somewhat mainstream, wearing more than one item from that list would be quite extroverted.

Other extroverted things would include: going sockless, monkstraps, bold colors, and slim cuts (especially as slim cuts leave the mainstream)."
malefashionadvice,"Wear a watch and a bracelet, sure.

Wear a bracelet that’s the same width as a watch on one wrist and a watch on the other? Sure, go for it.

malefashionadvice,"yeah NBs were part of it. ALD has had a relationship with New Balance for years thats produced at least 6 or so collab shoes. The founder is now the head of New Balances Made in the USA line. However, New Balance has always been sort of a prep brand since its Boston based and running shoes inspired.  And J Crew has carried New Balance and had its own collabs for over a decade (since the Todd Snyder Liquor store era). So that may be more of the fact that its always been apart of it.  Similarly, during that period the first wave of Gorpcore went viral, mostly riding on the back of the patagonia retro-x. Fleeces were just insanely popular that year.  I'd like to reinterate that it is not necessarily the items themselves (new balances, fleece, double knees) but the way they are combined that defined that era.  It's a more than the sum of the parts type situation.

malefashionadvice,"Thank you. Ever since I was a child, I've been good at looking"
malefashionadvice,"Simmilar commend to /u/afortuneforetold. Your outfit looks great (especially with the jacket), but it’s cool in tone whereas the shoes are very warm. That clashes. If you have darker shoes, even if they’re casual, it will go better. Maybe light but neutral, like white or cream sneakers, could work as well, but I haven’t tried that myself.

That being said, no one will actually see your shoes much at a concert, so go ahead and wear these if they make you feel nicer or more occasion-appropriate. I reckon shoe-tone advice applies more in settings when you expect people to be seeing you from head to toe (e.g., when you’re the one on stage)"

malefashionadvice,Which pants are you looking at. Their clothes generally fit pretty slim.
malefashionadvice,"I just bought a pair of these that may be something like you’re looking for. https://nomanwalksalone.com/products/grey-cavalry-twill-wool-trousers

They should be arriving today, so I can report back later. Obviously these specific ones are low stock, but look around No Man Walks Alone and you might find something. A lot of their trousers are at exactly that price point."
malefashionadvice,"That’s very true. However, it’s interesting what has happened modern stretchy fabrics, which have totally changed the game. 

I gained weight over COVID, and I have some pants that were semi slim before and are now just straight up too small, but they can still be worn comfortably because of stretch. Meanwhile I had to get rid of things that were loose before but can’t fit in the waist, because of the lack of stretch. 

Also, I have a chronic disease that often leads to stomach pain and/or bloating. When I’m dealing with that, (semi)slim stretch pants that stay up on their own are so much more comfortable than loose pants which require a belt or a properly fitted (read: slightly waist squeezing) waistband. 

I mean, there is a reason why women of all sizes adopted yoga pants as the “do everything” pant ten years ago, and never looked back. I think if inclusivity is the goal, allowing wider people to feel okay wearing clothing that is comfy but reveals their body shape, is just as important as making wider clothing."
malefashionadvice,"Loro Piano will try to make it happen but it will never happen.

The 911 is probably more like Jordan's. Always in the competition for best of the year, die hard fanatics lining up for releases and generally great looking year after year styling."

malefashionadvice,Thanks! Do you know how tellason's jacket compares to these other ones?
malefashionadvice,"Looks great, I'd love to see more of the sweater"
malefashionadvice,"Which totally vibes with what’s “in style” these days. Lots of throwback 90s/00s shapes and silhouettes. With NB it also helps that the price often matches the quality of materials and construction, which can’t always be said about expensive/hyped stuff. They are dad shoes, but dad shoes are in right now. 

The 990 is like the 911 of shoes. Classic silhouette that gets minor evolutions over time. High price point, high quality, to some people it’s just an expensive VW Beetle but to those who know it’s an icon for a reason."

malefashionadvice,"I agree that there is nothing wrong with German camo in particular (no Nazi connection) but this is pretty loud and very clearly military surplus. If someone sees this and they don’t think military, they will think hunting camo (like Realtree). 

That doesn’t mean you shouldn’t wear it, but the connotation is potentially there. Like, if you were going to a shooting range in rural Alabama and you wanted to fit in, this would help. If you were going to whatever is the exact opposite of that and you wanted fit in, this might not give a good first impression."
malefashionadvice,"**Can you wear a sports jacket at home?** (weird clarification below)

So, I've been playing a game called Persona 5 recently, where the protagonist wears this at home: [https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/megamitensei/images/f/ff/P5MC-Winter-Clothes.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/250?cb=20170420144854](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/megamitensei/images/f/ff/P5MC-Winter-Clothes.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/250?cb=20170420144854)

I'm really digging the highly casual look with the jacket, but I don't think I've ever seen something like that being worn indoors before.

Another thing is, I'm from Eastern Europe where it's not that common to wear sports jackets casually at all. So I don't have a point of reference of how weird would such homewear would seem to somebody in the West."

I'm lucky enough to live in Japan so I can get things from brands like Iron Heart, Pure Blue Japan, Samurai, Momotaro, Buzz Rickson, Tanuki, Sugar Cane, etc domestically. Also the exchange rate from USD to Yen is quite good at the moment. 

I have also gotten things from less well known brands in the range of $50 that has been quite good too. But the difference in quality between the $50 shirt and the above mentioned brands is quite different. It's not 4x better but it is much better."

It’s wild to me to even consider new balance as attempting to be “fashionable.” I wore a lot of new balance growing up because the previous years shoes always went on sale at Big 5 Sporting Goods and my mom could get the kids a pair of shoes for like $10-15 each. So to me I think they will always be just the cheapest thing you can put on your feet that money can buy.

The Leonores are fur-lined but they might be a bit warm come summer for living in. I started looking at Timberlands (dark brown leather, not the tans) which I like but they're lace-up and might be very heavy to wear all the time? I don't mind laces if they're not walking boot chore level to do up. I'm lazy, you see.

malefashionadvice,I'm down 150 pounds and need an entire new wardrobe and had _no idea_ how to style my new body shape. Thanks for making this.
malefashionadvice,"Loro Piana is having a moment because LVMH who acquired the brand is trying to promote it.  One of the LVMH owner’s sons is running this brand so it’s getting a lot of attention.  Prior to being acquired, Loro Piana was always expensive but still within reach of the upper middle class like senior management, lawyers, regular bankers and doctors. Their quality was top notch.  

LVMH has now moved pricing of regular fashion brands with crappy quality up to where pricing of Loro Piana used to be and this has caused all the major fashion houses like Gucci, Burberry and YSL to follow suit.  Meanwhile over the last 20 years there has been an erosion in tailoring, material quality and manufacturing origin (manufacturing in lower cost countries in Asia and Eastern Europe rather than Italy, France and UK.)    

Loro Piana meanwhile has moved pricing up to cater exclusively to the top 0.1%.    They also engage in monopolistic behavior like purchasing all the ultra-fine wool in the world (marketed as “Gift of Kings”) to prevent other brands from getting access to the material so they can continue to charge eye watering prices. 

Yeah, I have a wardrobe full of Loro Piana but these pieces were mostly acquired prior to the LVMH takeover.  I don’t bother with the mainstream luxury brands anymore.  Much better to find smaller classic brands that still maintain high quality.  

Like why would I buy an Easy Walk shoe for over $1500 which goes into the garbage when the soles wear out when I can buy a better quality Northampton UK shoe  for similar prices which will practically last forever.  
TBH, I would say most of luxury consumers today are unsophisticated and don’t understand true luxury."

It really depends on what you want. You can get something from Uniqlo that's ""good enough"" or you can get something that's thick, 100% cotton, well built collar and seams, etc that can get pretty pricey. 

I'm wearing a WonderLooper Fox Fiber pullover with a chainstitch embroidery that I had dyed with natural indigo. It's a really nice piece but most people wouldn't think it's worth the price I paid.

malefashionadvice,"I'm such a silly goose. I thought this was named after the sawtooth mountains because it's a western shirt. 

The actual teeth of a saw never even crossed my mind. T.i.l."
malefashionadvice,"Fascinating. Most of these micro trends flew right by me when they were happening. But I was fortunate enough to pick up some J Crew exclusive MiUSA New Balance 998s in 2018/2019, which are my favorite it sneakers I’ve ever owned.

It sound like those NBs were part of this? I also remember seeing super duper chunky vintage-inspired fleece jacket and vests, at the J Crew store when I bought the NBs, which were so obviously a repro of this type of thing:

malefashionadvice,I'm just wondering but what do y'all think about this [german military surplus jacket](https://www.varusteleka.com/en/product/bw-parka-tropentarn-surplus/11510)? I bought one recently and I've enjoyed wearing it but I'm worried it might have a negative connotation.
malefashionadvice,What are some of the best black jean jackets? Budget below $300. Not urgent so can wait for sales.
malefashionadvice,"Best shorts for average sized guys?

I’m under 6 foot and generally think shorts aren’t that flattering if you’re not tall. 
Convince me otherwise! What are your favorite shorts? It’s hot here in Texas already."
malefashionadvice,"This. While I do have a black suit, and yes, it does get worn to funerals, I'm almost the only one wearing a suit, much less a black one. Grey or blue IMO would be acceptable unless specifically instructed otherwise."
malefashionadvice,"Maybe this is all too common now but Lululemon is what I wear for travel (and office casual), specifically the Commuter slim line. Immensely comfortable (the Commuter IMO is slightly more dressy than their ABC pant, which is styled more like a jean pant). Very wrinkle-resistant, easy to wash, and again, super comfortable."
malefashionadvice,"Lol I do it because I love fashion and the industry.

It's also with a bespoke designer, not some large company. We use the same factory that Todd Snyder, Hockey Freeman, Ralph Lauren, and many others use, but under our own label. We also sell Zegna products, which isn't common for such a small business (4 employees)."
malefashionadvice,imagine being this high and mighty about being a jobber lol
malefashionadvice,I think Open Walks are ugly personally and look like a slightly nicer version of something you’d get in a subscription box. Think that’s my only real issue with LP. I used to think it was basically Uniqlo for uber rich 50 year old dudes but I’ve come around on it more. They’re using the best materials in the world and make truly luxurious looking stuff without it being flashy. I absolutely respect their brand pretty much representing the pinnacle of quality. Still l guess unless I was wiping my ass with money it’s still not exactly my vibe.
malefashionadvice,"What would y’all call that predominantly west coast beach vibe/aesthetic? Like the baggies, t shirts, that whole laid back feel &amp; look?"
malefashionadvice,"US-made, I think that may really be challenging at that price point, and even US-label brands probably have their stuff made overseas. I have a slim blazer from Uniqlo (unlined, no shoulder padding) that got me through a week long conference that was well under $100. I think the brand is great if it fits, and the price/value can't be beat."
malefashionadvice,Lol necessary where I love unfortunately
malefashionadvice,"Thanks, I'm a huge fan of a light pink, used correctly."
malefashionadvice,Yep! and visvim
malefashionadvice,"They’re both fine, imo. Are the thin ones Shoes Like Pottery?  What brand are the thick ones?"

malefashionadvice,Jackets are probably the one thing of theirs I’d spring for — it’s super hard to get just the right amount and configuration of shoulder structure and their fabric selection is great
malefashionadvice,"Something that I feel is often lost in this discussion is the reality that Kendall misses the mark in many of his fits. He wears nothing but super expensive clothes, lots of Loro Piana and Tom Ford, but they don’t always gel together, there are lots of details off, he looks awkward and lacks confidence in his clothes. It perfectly serves the character and story, but there’s a certain level of irony in the audience’s interest in emulating Kendall’s look, because I’m convinced the show’s costume department deliberately signals to us that he’s not quite pulling it off most of the time."
malefashionadvice,"Seconding Meermin. You can get three of those bad boys for the same price as one decent leather belt at Nordstrom, and Meermin’s will most likely be better anyway."
malefashionadvice,I like the thick ones better.
malefashionadvice,"for sure! some tinkering with spier’s MTO program and a few solid pairs of flared trousers pretty much clinches the look—some of husbands’ fabrics are stunning, though (there’s this one gunchecked sportcoat i’ve lusted over for years at this point)"
malefashionadvice,"Having been to their store in Paris, their stuff is good but it’s really mostly the styling, much like ALD. If you have the time, you can put together their stuff on the cheap. I’d only buy their stuff if you don’t have the time to do so"
malefashionadvice,I will hold out with hope!

malefashionadvice,"They are obviously more than doubling down on wallabies these days as there are so many more color ways and textile and all leather options. I bet the “all crepe” ones has the ones you mentioned.

malefashionadvice,The real question is pocket or not
malefashionadvice,"This is the worst thing I learned today. ^^I ^^assume ^^its ^^a ^^dad ^^thing, ^^shoes ^^easy ^^on ^^and ^^off"
malefashionadvice,"Just use the basic bastard guide as a shopping list, most of what’s in there can be found in any mall, unless you’re planning on wearing this stuff consistently I would not worry about minmaxing quality and find whatever fits you the best, Uniqlo is the meme answer, so is J Crew

little blunt but the Atom shoes don’t look great and shoes kinda make or break an outfit, if you think you’d probably be fine with sneakers Vans, Converse, Sambas, Air Force 1s, are all relatively easy to find and look better"
malefashionadvice,"You can check Spier and MacKay for both - they have decent stuff at good prices. If you go for a blazer, go for one as casual as possible. 

I'm sure you can get away with wearing whatever shoes - it just won't look very good. They'll dress down the whole outfit a lot."
malefashionadvice,"nvm, just noticed, but yeah the sneakers are basically identical man, it’s entirely personal preference"
malefashionadvice,"I like Paul Mescal's long jacket, has rakish flair while being the opposite of stuffy."
malefashionadvice,"Did you link the wrong pics? It’s two different fits, and the sneakers look identical"
malefashionadvice,"It’s SF so the shoes are probably fine still but yeah a blazer or sweater could work? Any recommendations? Brands or styles?

180/5 10 if that helps"
malefashionadvice,"I like brown. I have a brown corduroy puffer that I wear a lot, and I get a ton of compliments on it. But that’s me. Let’s talk about you. Does either color fill a hole in your wardrobe? Does one of the colors work better with things you already own? Do either of them take you in a direction you want to go?"
malefashionadvice,"So you may want to peruse the ""basic bastard"" guide to get a sense for how to dress a little bit more refined. It'll be pretty tricky to do in all black though because that's usually reserved for only the most formal outfits (like a tuxedo) or the most casual (like your daily wear).

You'll also have to figure out how ""up"" you want to dress. Do you want to wear something like a casual blazer? A nice sweater? 

The hardest part of your budget goal is definitely shoes. Decent non-sneakers generally start at around $200 or so. If you have time, you can get something good used for quite a bit less."
malefashionadvice,What do you call those button up shirts that have that weird half cape on the back of it with mesh lining underneath it. Vented hiking shirt?
malefashionadvice,"I would actually disagree with you about Cuccinelli. Not only are their designs more interesting than LP or others in their price range, but they do have a very clear and very clearly-articulated point of view: hyper-ethical clothing made the old way. It's luxury, but produced such that every single gram of material used is tracked from raw to finished product and every person who touches it is being treated fairly and equitably along the way. They really were the first to make that level of sustainability and ethical production the cornerstone of their brand, and it's a strong enough point of view that you don't need to have weird pockets or outlandish cuts in your clothing to remain valid."
malefashionadvice,"thanks virt! husbands is one of my favorite brands atm, wish i could afford to buy pretty much everything they've ever put out

yeah the trousers in the first fit are such a pain––even when i do wear them at home, i need to cinch them into place with a belt"
malefashionadvice,"aw thank you &lt;3 big fan of extra long belts, but it's always a hassle finding one that nails the silhouette and still fits"
malefashionadvice,Yep sorry definitely open to buying. Dunno under 500 total for the outfit?
malefashionadvice,"&gt;What started out as (and still is) a satire of the ultra-wealthy

Sorry, I'm going to have to vehemently disagree with you here. Succession is not, and never was, a ""satire"" of the ultra-wealthy. No more so than *Catch Me If You Can* and *Wolf of Wall Street* are satires of scammers, or *Breaking Bad* is a satire of criminal drug enterprises.

*Succession* is a full-throated pean to the awesomeness of being a billionaire. Yes, the kids are all morons, but they're morons who are cool and get pretty much everything they want. And Logan is constantly being held up as a man to be admired and emulated, even if he is a terrible person. The show puts it's characters on such a hilarious pedestal, even while they're doing the dumbest thing imaginable, and you're constantly being told ""look, the kids may be dumb, but Logan... now THERE is a real man's man.""

Silicon Valley is a satire of the ultra-rich. Arrested Development is a satire of the ultra-rich. Brewster's Millions and Trading Places are a satires of the ultra-rich. Succession is just a mediocre soap-opera comedy of the Tom and Jerry format with one rich old guy playing Jerry and his incompetent children playing Tom. But at no point does it offer any real critique of wealth or privilege beyond ""lol, aren't these zany kids so hilariously out of touch and stupid? Good thing their money prevents anything truly bad from ever happening to them!"""

malefashionadvice,Good point
malefashionadvice,"It amuses me that Loro Piana gets so much hate in these posts. I've worked in luxury retail for many years and my respect for them has only gotten higher. This subreddit skews on the younger side and it will always gravitate towards the flashier, more streetwear, more celebrity driven brands (ie, LV, Dior, Gucci) when it comes to aspirational luxury. (Not everyone here, but a significant proportion.) No one really wants to be the ""boring"" guy wearing ""classic"" clothes.

Having worked with some of these big luxury brands and seeing the degradation of the quality that it used to deliver, it's amusing to see them focus instead on hype, print T-shirts/Sweaters and logo heavy streetwear as their bread and butter. (Nothing wrong with streetwear, I myself have plenty of it.) I don't blame them at all for that, it's where the money's at. Streetwear basics are easy to produce and is marked up like crazy. And when it comes to ""eye catching design"" it's easy to sell a machine stitched card holder at Louis Vuitton with it's plastic monogram (sorry, cOaTeD cAnVas) to your standard middle class 20 year old compared to selling a plain cashmere sweater from a brand that uses vertically integrated manufacturing as a selling point. 

Every luxury brand has their certain marketing that they push relentlessly, it's all expensive fashion. But I gotta say, Loro Piana is one of the few that really delivers what I expect from luxury. Others may have a different idea what luxury means to them..."

I usually wear all black cotton T-shirt’s and a pair of all black Patagonia pants with black/white atom’s shoes and def don’t go to events like this often.

Now I was invited to a prestigious event and of course since it’s SF the dress code is casual but the event space is upscale and the attendance is selective so I can’t just wear my normal whatever clothes.

And literally all I have is these things, I just find clothes I like and buy duplicates so I just have a shit ton of black t shirts and black Patagonia pants.

How would I class it up a bit but still be refined? Also still want all black.

Any help appreciated"

malefashionadvice,"Definitely change your shirt to white. You really don’t need to match your wife’s dress in any way other than formality. 

I would encourage you to not try to match her color at all.  If you absolutely insist on matching her color then do it in a subtle way such as having the secondary color on your tie match. Then wear a white linen pocket square."

malefashionadvice,So your take is irrelevant to the convo then lol
malefashionadvice,"For a black suit, Men’s Wearhouse on sale, Macy’s or Jos. A Bank are good choices.  Just make sure what you’re buying is wool not synthetic.  The suit won’t be very versatile, and since you’re not wearing it often you don’t really need to worry about how durable it will be.  

The only real value options are in second hand suits, otherwise you get what you pay for."

malefashionadvice,Thank you Ben J Serv
malefashionadvice,"Thanks!

Yes they are. The Michaels are nice but I always loved the clean lines of the Chambords."
malefashionadvice,"yes and also no. 

I use 2019 as the reference point because thats (plus or minus) when the big NYC prep revivalist brands really hit the mainstream.  It was the first ALD collection that hit mainstream appeal, it was the start of Blowing Razors (now extremely corny) collabs (particularly the barbour one) and NOAH's peak.  It was just when all the ""Is Prep Back??"" articles about those three and niche aesthetics really started gearing up.  I would say [FW2020](https://www.aimeleondore.com/pages/fall-winter-2020-the-worlds-borough) was the peak of ALD's Neo-Prep arc.  That 2-3 year period sort of solidified the aesthetic as a prep revival trend. It may have been bubbling under the surface but it really hit mainstream then and has kinda fallen back out since then.

As for Yes, rugbies, ocbds chinos, milsurp and sneakers have been apart of prep for years (if not decades).  However, the difference, as always in the details.  For example, a barbour, sweatshirt, ocbd, indigo jeans and white common projects was a big 2010s prep-heiritage revival look (and would have been very evident on MFA). These are not the items that define neo-prep.

When we're talking sneakers, it's not minimalist white sneakers, but decidedly hype sneakers: jordans, Air Maxes, New Balance 990s and collabs.  Its a product of the post stockx 2010s sneaker hype. The other major influence is how black kids in NYC repurposed polo and prep in the 90s.

Styling itself follows less of the 2010s heritage prep revival or the golden age of ivy style and is more along the lines of what one could find in an upper east side thrift store.  The focus is less on the rules of ivy and more on re-interpreting heritage styles and vintage aesthetics. Think about it like finding a vintage brooks brothers top coat, and a cable knit fishermans sweater that you pair with the carhartt double knees and jordan 4s.  Or how ALD styled it by pairing vintage denim with loafers (loafers had a big moment around that time) with a fleece and yankees cap or a tweed ball cap with a hoodie and some loose fitting corduroys with timberland lug soled boat shoes."
malefashionadvice,"No one is arguing it’s not good quality, I’ve looked through the fabric they offer before while searching for samples for patchwork, it’s not particularly unique, they’re not a brand that prides themselves on making super out there clothes"
malefashionadvice,"That's fine enough, but fabric coming from their mills is fantastic and gorgeous."
malefashionadvice,"We’re talking about the clothed the brand makes.

Suiting doesn’t mean boring, that suiting fabric, however, is plain, I literally sW tons of that from the cheap suits I sold when I worked at macys that was near identical, I’m glad you like it but it’s not very unique or interesting patterns"
malefashionadvice,"No, it's literal fabric from the LP mills. We sell it under our label.

Subtle doesn't mean boring. The gray with light blue stitching is gorgeous"
malefashionadvice,"So you aren’t selling LP, you’re selling brands that use LP fabric, which isn’t what anyone is talking about.

either way if those are the most interesting fabrics you have to pull up it’s not exactly changing my mind, LP isn’t some niche brand no one’s seem anything of"
malefashionadvice,"They don't with what I sell. You'd have to actually go out of your way to find it. The mills are different from what exactly the brand retails, if that makes sense. I still don't think the pictures I posted are boring."
malefashionadvice,"Once again, no one is arguing they aren’t high quality, they just don’t make interesting clothes, I know when things are LP because brands make sure to label the fabric as LP"
malefashionadvice,"Yeah, agree to disagree. I sell a lot from Loro Piana. You probably just don't know when it's from their mills because it's not sold under their label. These are just pictures I took because I loved the fabric and designs."
malefashionadvice,Reported for bullying me 😤
malefashionadvice,I run into this at my office sometimes too.  I wore loafers one time and had people commenting how dressed up i was.  Like when did any leather shoe somehow become fancy?

malefashionadvice,All are good choices. Note that the Rancourt loafers in your pic are not the beefroll loafers. I enjoy ranger mocs but can't think of outfits where they work and loafers don't.
malefashionadvice,"I agree with that. But I also think that looking attractive is hard to pin down and is a part of fashion. It’s not always about the obvious sex appeal. It can be about it looking bold, thoughtful, creative, or non conforming. Those things can be attractive to others both sexually and in a plutonic away.

I’m not sure about the language “show off your body”, but I do think that the way clothes look with one’s body is absolutely a part of fashion. Clothes can be interesting because of how they interplay with your body. Clothes are worn in the body after all. The interplay is an inescapable part of fashion. It doesn’t mean clothes have to be a certain way. But it’s part of the equation."
malefashionadvice,"I'm in search of a quality dress/casual belt. I looked through several threads of belt suggestions on this sub, and hankbelts are highly recommended.

Is it worth it? Any alternatives that cost less than $115?"
malefashionadvice,"Thats a perfectly good reason to choose slimmer clothing but this seems like you want to use clothes as an avenue to show off your body (which is a totally fine and valid thing to do) and less because you are into menswear itself as hobby which is a big distinction i think people get hung up on with here.  The goal for people into fashion as a hobby is not to show off their body, it’s to wear clothes they like and find interesting"
malefashionadvice,"I want to buy [this jacket](https://www.ralphlauren.com/men-clothing-jackets-coats-vests/convertible-corduroy-down-jacket/0046265864.html?utm_source=CSE&amp;utm_medium=GooglePLA_1413327634973_14492275359_126136144465&amp;gbraid=0AAAAADvCVOBYvVWrTVPpsPg4z2wRFo85A&amp;gbraid=0AAAAADvCVOBYvVWrTVPpsPg4z2wRFo85A&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMI8_C3w_y2_QIVegCtBh25SAPzEAQYASABEgLuzPD_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds) in either brown or navy but I’m not sure which one. I’ve been thinking about it for t he past few days but I like them both equally.

Which one would you guys recommend and why?"
malefashionadvice,Layered it with the ONI Kiwami Type III jacket. Just to do it to em.
malefashionadvice,Well said
malefashionadvice,That aspect of the sub still definitely exists but there is only so much to be said on the topic of “how do i not look like a slob” so of course it has expanded into a wider subject matter.  Alot of people come here looking to dress better and end up getting into the hobby and getting more creative with there dressing so its become an outlet for that as well.  If anything i think its a good thing to have this sub cater to a wider audience
malefashionadvice, Does anyone know about Octobre Editions? Can’t find any reviews for them but their pants look interesting as a bridge between backing off slim fit without getting too oversized.
malefashionadvice,Your loafers are the most beautiful shoes I've seen in this sub
malefashionadvice,"Hey guys I'm traveling to Europe next summer and want to add a summer shoe to my wardrobe. I'll be mostly wearing summer weight cotton pants or linen cotton blends with button down shirts. I own a pair of grant stone boots but I'm wondering if I should go with some Rancourt beef roll penny loafers or a pair of their ranger moc's. Or if I would be better off getting a Grant Stone loafer?

malefashionadvice,"I would say subdued in comparison to a tailoring house like Isaia. Most people who sell “Lori Piana Suits” have their fabric books and they are made elsewhere. There basic range is from safe 150s and then jump to very fine high twist 170 ranges. Like a lot of other high end mills suits aren’t really the swatch book for wow fabrics, that’s usually odd coats. Other brands have more interesting base colors grounds or in case of Kiton or VBC they have interesting performance fabrics."

malefashionadvice,"&gt;It's all very strange and laden with naturalized/essentialized assumptions of what a person should look like.

&gt;My partner is non-binary and, especially on days where they feel dysphoric, feel most comfortable with large wool pants or large pleated skirt, a big sweater, and a shawl.

This is one of the reasons why I prefer looser cuts. I don't dislike my body, but hiding it makes me feel more androgynous and boyish in them. I believe that clothes should be flattering to some extent, but the way many people, especially women, discuss this topic irks me. It's subjective."

malefashionadvice,"Yeah it’s pretty much impossible online. In the case of Bonobos, their suit pants seem to be consistently higher than their other pants. But in the case of BR it’s a complete crapshoot how a particular style will fit. I mean, they have certain fits (I think mine are “tailored”) but the names of these fits are illogical, and each fit is not necessarily consistent."
malefashionadvice,Some straight up shlubs in there.
malefashionadvice,"I don't know why you're getting downvoted and tend to agree. They're t-shirts. Find a brand you like where the sizing works for you and just keep going back to the well. Uniqlo is a solid starting point. Though I'm between their medium and large sizes, so YMMV I guess. 

That one merino t-shirt that gets recommended all the time is nice, but it's extremely specific and not really what the average person is asking for when they ask for basic t-shirt recommendations."

malefashionadvice,"firstly, I didn't say ""slim fit is becoming unfashionable"", that was somebody else

secondly, there is no conflict between the statements. what is ""fashionable"" or ""unfashionable"" is a reflection of a cultural zeitgeist, with which one can choose to participate or not participate, not some kind of objective rule about what is or is not acceptable to wear. slim fit is not currently in fashion but that doesn't mean anybody can't or shouldn't wear it."

malefashionadvice,"Spier and McKay, SuitSupply, Pini Parma, The Armoury are some that I know of. 

I also recently bought some pants that are decent — not as high as I’d like but better than most of what I’ve worn the past decade: Bonobos (suit pants), Banana Republic (only some styles), Ted Baker."

malefashionadvice,"I have a navy suit from Suitsupply and I think it was a very good value. Certainly better than Men's Warehouse. It was in the $500-$600 range. Navy suit, simple dark tie, and black shoes is fine for most funerals. Navy is better than black because you can wear it to basically anything."
malefashionadvice,"&gt; I'm not going to reply with that because this hypothetical transman has clearly stated their goal. I'm going to reply with information and thoughts about what types of clothing and styles are more masculine coded like workwear and traditional tailoring.

I would argue that there aren't many contexts where, ""Wear what makes you happy!"" is useful advice. It seems like it mostly gets used as a cudgel to shut down discussion.

&gt; Maybe it is a tough balance, but I think you'll get further talking about your relationship and your wants and desires than about pants.

Sure, but I wasn't really looking for advice here. I was just offering an interesting anecdote three levels deep in somebody else's conversation about ""flattering"" vs. ""interesting"" fashion. I wondered what other people's partners thought about baggy pants. I really wasn't expecting people to jump all over me."
malefashionadvice,"Recommendations for dress pants or chinos that actually sit at the waist? I’ve grown a little gut and I’d like some business casual pants that are more flattering. Seems like all my stuff is low-rise, but I was wearing a suit this weekend with higher rise pants and I felt like the rise was a way better look for me and didn’t accentuate my belly so much. I don’t know where to look for higher waisted pants/shorts that I can wear on a daily basis though."

malefashionadvice,Check out the famous rock stars of the late 70’s and 80’s. The ones not wearing bell bottoms were wearing non-stretchy pants so tight it was practically indecent
malefashionadvice,Beige and grey are my favourite colours to wear tonal fits with. I think it’s because they’re both neutral enough that it’s easier to identify their warmer and cooler tones. It’s tougher to differentiate warmer and cooler shades of blue or orange.
malefashionadvice,"I gotcha. I actually don't know what they sell under their label. We have our own, but we get really great designs from them (in my opinion).

We also only sell suits, sport coats, slacks, and vests from them."
malefashionadvice,There are still plenty of fashionable outlets selling skinny and slim cuts. Those same brands are also carrying relaxed fit and loose cuts. It’s all in.
malefashionadvice,"The 2000s is when I noticed a good mixture of trends, some still wearing loose clothing, boot cut and even bell bottoms, slim and skinny, cowboy look (I literally remember urban “cowboys” wearing wrangler jeans and cowboy hats, skaters wearing skinny jeans and big or tight shirts.

malefashionadvice,"I sell suits that come from the Loro Piana factory and it is as advertised. The fabrics are absolutely phenomenal and are used to make so many of the great fashion designers. Anywhere from Hickey Freeman, Ralph Lauren, to Tom Ford.

Today's fit. I've been buying up vintage oxfords because of their collar rolls being so much better than current ones, so far LL Bean and Brooks Brothers have been the best. This one is LL Bean and it's slightly more anemic than those. Still better than a lot of what's currently available though!

Last night's fit

[https://imgur.com/a/jhzW4V8](https://imgur.com/a/jhzW4V8)

Couldn't figure out decent lighting. Sport coat is black and white herringbone cashmere, shirt is grey vertical stripes, pants are black flannel, suspenders are burgundy, boots are black.  I've never really tried suspenders before, no idea why. They're really comfortable and add a nice pop of color."
malefashionadvice,What are your best replacements for Unis chinos? I really liked their Gio fit chinos.
malefashionadvice,"One way to justify is knowing your style.

I tried experimenting with expensive brands, figuring I might as well try the ""best"", and I found out I was more a house sweater/moleskin vs streetstyle/hoody/joggers.

&amp;#x200B;

Don't have advise for brands of staples. But I have seen my daily outlook get better by upgrading sheets (found out I preferred percale to sateen, Lands End)/blankets (down, LL Bean)/towels (turkish, Etsy)."
malefashionadvice,"Oh, this is 100% accurate. At the very least, many of these people have an implicit racist/classist bias without realizing it. It's the same thing when people hate on sneakers or hip hop, or when people say that certain clothes are more ""proper"" or ""sophisticated."" Some menswear enthusiasts rub me the wrong way because of these kinds of things"
malefashionadvice,Steroid time let’s goo
malefashionadvice,"Yeah you basically described the 2023 starter pack lol. The 10-year sequel to the quality OCBD, slim raws and welted work boots from before"
malefashionadvice,"No I don’t think you’re out of touch. Once you’re past a certain point where nice clothing is your hobby the price takes a different meaning and a higher price is usually associated with details nerds like me are interested in. You seem to have a more functional relationship with clothes, and there is nothing wrong with that."
malefashionadvice,"&gt; This is the take that bothers me the most.

I don't think it was really a take, it was just me idly wondering aloud. 
 
&gt; Firstly, not everyone dresses for attraction. I think thats important to understand. Upholding that pragmatism is the true dangerous thing, rather than the opposite: letting men in here know that there is an alternate goal in dressing. Expression can be internally motivated, not always external.

Yeah, for sure. I'm interested in clothes, which is why I'm here. I think the way you dress is awesome and you seem like a great guy. You obviously have fun with your style and that's really cool.

&gt; Also, people can form and maintain relationships independent of clothing. Wearing something that your wife doesn't find attractive or that your friends may think is odd will not ruin your relationship. 

Sure, but I do think it's important to continue to court your partner throughout your life, and part of that is trying to be attractive to them. It doesn't mean you build your whole style around them, but if I know my partner really likes my butt in a certain pair of pants, I'm going to wear those pants for her. Conversely, when she said my beaded necklace phase made me look ridiculous (it did), I found some other things I liked.

I also think I'm just not as into clothes as expression as some of the people here. I think clothes are fun, but the most happiness I get from them is when people compliment them. My best experiences with MFA have been when I see some new style or brand on here, try it out, and my wife goes, ""Daaaaamn!"" 

I think that's probably true for a lot of people who come here. They have other hobbies; they just want to know how to present themselves well. That's why they're on MFA and not Styleforum. And for those people, I think ""What do women prefer on men?"" is a relevant question (one I'm still idly wondering about)."
malefashionadvice,"it's boxier, but GT and three are probably what people will consider actually boxy."
malefashionadvice,"Beige and brown, inspired by my face 😂"
malefashionadvice,"Neither actually! I meant more like it sticks out from the rest of the outfit. As in it doesn’t quite feel harmonious in color, pattern, texture, etc with most fits I have tried to wear it with."

malefashionadvice,Spoken like someone who hasn't even taken a sip of TGF beta
malefashionadvice,"Based on the size charts, you probably want the first pair. 874s don't have much taper and the first pair of pants has less taper than the second, also seems a little wider in general. I had a pair of the second pants a few years ago and they were pretty slim."
malefashionadvice,"&gt; How do you tell quality brands from drop shipped garbage?

I'd strictly avoid anyone that uses a black mannequin. [Here](https://i.imgur.com/fcpiDvc.jpeg) and [here](https://i.imgur.com/BROFePp.jpeg) are some 4chan PSAs."
malefashionadvice,Just one of each? I know merino doesn't need to be washed as much as other fabrics.
malefashionadvice,"&gt; and you answer, ""Wear what will make you happy!"" it's worse than useless, it's condescending.

I'm not going to reply with that because this hypothetical transman has clearly stated their goal. I'm going to reply with information and thoughts about what types of clothing and styles are more masculine coded like workwear and traditional tailoring. 

&gt;I think they're fun, but the people around me weren't viewing me the way I wanted them to, and that makes for a tough balance.

This is different! You so far haven't really mentioned that you _like_ the straight-fit more! Just that you were experimenting.

&gt; It also makes me wonder whether a bunch of other malefashionadvice guys have wives thoroughly unimpressed with their baggy trousers.

This is truly a thing! Everyone knows that the true mark of a good fit is disapproval from your partner (some sarcasm here). But like my fiance isn't going to stop loving me because I wear pants she doesn't love. Maybe it is a tough balance, but I think you'll get further talking about your relationship and your wants and desires than about pants."
malefashionadvice,Yeah they all should have been tailored better. A lot of the legs are too long
malefashionadvice,"I think you're right about most of those ones in particular, but something like [this](https://i.imgur.com/DdVqKX5.jpg) is a bit wider fitting and looks great"

malefashionadvice,"&gt; This is the context thing I'm talking about. If you want to dress well according to what your peers at the office think, then talk to them or just look at what they are wearing and wear that!

I mean, yes, this is a big part of what I'm saying. I don't think context is emphasized on MFA nearly enough. Take the example that I just used, which you replied so vehemently about: if you are a millennial who works with millennials and dates millennials, then wide fits might not be the current trend in your social circle. That's context! 

&gt; These are also questions that a lot of other people have to wrestle with just to exist. How does a transman dress to present themselves as the man they want to be to the world? What about a gay man? What about a woman in menswear? These questions that you are assuming are nice platitudes are things that other people have to tackle inherently in other contexts.

You've made my point exactly. For the people you're describing, ""What will allow me to present myself the way I wish to be seen?"" is the relevant question. That's what interests me, and that's what many people come to MFA for, I think. If a transman is trying to figure out what they can wear to present as masculine, and you answer, ""Wear what will make you happy!"" it's worse than useless, it's condescending.

In my case, the stakes were much lower, but I thought it was interesting that a couple of women I talked to find wider fits unattractive. I think they're fun, but the people around me weren't viewing me the way I wanted them to, and that makes for a tough balance. I thought it was an interesting discussion, but... here we are."
malefashionadvice,Thanks!! I'm quite happy with it.

malefashionadvice,"&gt; your appearance plays an important role in your social interactions

This is the context thing I'm talking about. If you want to dress well according to what your peers at the office think, then talk to them or just look at what they are wearing and wear that! Are company golf polos the big thing folks wear? Or are people wearing jeans and tee shirts?

&gt; Friend, you're in a subreddit called malefashionadvice. People come here because they want to improve the way they present themselves socially.

This first step for any task, especially ""self-improvement"", is to determine your goals. I _don't_ want to improve the way I present myself socially. I want to wear cool clothes that I enjoy and dress in a way that I think is cool. I think it's a useful reflection. What will make you happy? You mentioned above that you want to dress in a way where your wife thinks you're hot. That's a great answer! What's the best way to accomplish that goal _and make you happy?_ Is it a) go to an online fashion forum with a bunch of dudes on it who are not your wife or b) go shopping with your wife and ask her opinions on stuff as you try different styles/cuts/etc.?

It's not a nice platitude, it's required pre-work.

&gt;People come here because they want to improve the way they present themselves socially.

What does this mean? You're married so you're obviously not trying to impress more than one lady, but that's not the case with everyone. Are other folks trying to attract cis white millennial women, queer gen z folks? What contexts are you dressing in? Are you trying to improve social standing at the local dive or a concert you're going to, or at the office or in interviews? What does ""improve"" even mean? Actions to impress your boss probably won't play the same way with the boys down at the pub. Asking yourself ""what will make me happy?"" is essential!

These are also questions that a lot of other people have to wrestle with just to exist. How does a transman dress to present themselves as the man they want to be to the world? What about a gay man? What about [a woman in menswear?](https://www.reapersower.com/blog/what-is-it-like-being-a-woman-in-menswear) These questions that you are assuming are nice platitudes are things that other people have to tackle inherently in other contexts. 

&gt;Well, having a fancy computer won't make your partner swoon when you walk into a room, nor will a bad computer make them embarrassed to be seen with you. Your computer also won't affect the way your peers at work view you

None of this is true! Cars are _famously_ a social signifier alone! And what car you drive will mean different things to different groups of people, just like clothes! So you _need_ to self-reflect and figure out what your priorities are and what groups you do and do not care about. You might care about gaining social status with a group that doesn't even care about clothes all that much! And social interactions are all contextual. You don't wear the same clothes to the bar as you do to an interview."

She and our German shepherds wouldn't get slobbery during playtime, but their tennis balls would be thoroughly soaked. Like, squelching in your hand, visible saliva flying off when you throw them soaked. We generally kept towels nearby to dry our hands off with.

I think I’ve gotten relatively okay at distinguishing well-made clothing from bad, but whatever level of excellence  that is supposed to set these hyper-luxury brands apart from the normal peasant-luxury tier…I just can’t see it. Not saying it doesn’t exist, but I feel like it must be the sartorial equivalent of a sound so loud that only dogs can hear it.

Leo Woodall similarly, where the puddle pants don't work, but if you cropped so there wasn't a break it would have been much better.  I think Jeremy Allen White  actually pulled this off well, where he had a straight fit, pants matching the proportions of the jacket, and it cropped to the right length for him."

malefashionadvice,"Cashmere pills.

This isn't a great use of cashmere, if we're being honest. Yes, it's super soft next to your skin which feels extra cuddly as a hoodie. But the structure of a hoodie doesn't lend itself to the actual fabric of cashmere. (Specific garments are made with specific fabrics for a reason, it's not just a whim of the style gods.) High quality cashmere also isn't typically used for hoodies for exactly this reason. Discerning customers aren't going to buy that, or if they are they're Elon Musk and can afford to replace their pilling cashmere hoodie every 6 months. So these types of garments are usually made with cheap low quality cashmere that pills even easier than the good stuff. 

Get a cashmere cardigan. Ideally from a more traditional/less streetwear or sportswear brand. In a classic style."

malefashionadvice,"&gt; It also makes me wonder whether a bunch of other malefashionadvice guys have wives thoroughly unimpressed with their baggy trousers.

This is the take that bothers me the most. 

Firstly, not everyone dresses for attraction. I think thats important to understand. Upholding that pragmatism is the true dangerous thing, rather than the opposite: letting men in here know that there is an alternate goal in dressing. Expression can be internally motivated, not always external. 

Also, people can form  and maintain relationships independent of clothing. Wearing something that your wife doesn't find attractive or that your friends may think is odd will not ruin your relationship. If it does, I'd think the relationship was formed on shaky ground that doesn't give room for personal expression. 

Personally I used to think that my mode of dress was a detriment but then i started to find people who not just didn't care, but *understood* clothes as an avenue for personal interest and expression. After that, i realized i didn't have to waste my time with people who don't get it.

And even if my partner doesn't like my pants, shoes, or hat one day doesn't mean she's going to break up with me on the spot. But also she understands i dress for myself and not for her."

If you don't _like_ the styles being recommended, then don't wear them! That's it! Dress in a way that makes you happy and random people on the internet can't tell you what that is! So MFA shouldn't try to optimize for dressing in a way that's ""flattering"" (whatever that means) and MFA shouldn't ""do a survey of folks attracted to men"" to optimize whatever metric that attempts to capture. MFA isn't doing a disservice to anyone because it's a free, user-content generated site. It would be a ""disservice"" if MFA was a for-profit blog that advertised dressing millennials in clothes in the slim-fit style of the 2010s and then recommended Levi's 501s. 

To steal a take from someone else: context will always be more important than trends. On the internet, context is removed, so it makes sense for MFA (a random internet forum about fashion) to talk about and focus on the current and prevailing trends. On the other side of the equation, I feel like no one else is putting in an iota of effort to figure out what their contexts are and what makes them happy. Even down to insanely basic stuff like ""I live in a fair hot climate, so maybe I won't need an armada of wool sweaters and this inspiration album (derived from a style that originated in New England) doesn't apply to me."""

malefashionadvice,"What's the formality level of the event? I would let that dictate what you do.

Assuming it is a relatively traditional wedding and other guests will be in suits, I would just pack the suit and ship it home after the wedding. Or possibly ship the suit to the wedding destination/a friend who'll be attending the wedding who doesn't have the packing limitations you do.

Or, IDK, just pack the suit and incorporate it into the rest of your trip. Who says you can't wear a suit around Europe?

malefashionadvice,"I'll just say imo it's just a lot of insecurities manifesting, you see it all across reddit. If a bodybuilder hits a front page non fitness related sub tons of people come out of the woodwork to imply they have a small dick/are insecure/women don't actually like that etc. Even more if it's a strongman who tend to look hefty. Tats are mocked, piercings are mocked, dyed hair is mocked, fashion is mocked, it's just people who are terrified that they aren't what they desperately want to be. Especially cause they themselves couldn't imagine standing out.

They gravitate to those incel things because they aren't that hard, and don't cause irl confrontation. Not masturbating isn't really that hard, but it lets them delude themselves that they are better than everyone else. Unsurprising fascism feeds on insecurity.

That's not to say the rise of far right rhetoric isn't terrifying (it is)."

You may be buying socks that are overly warm/technical/hiking-oriented vs. dress socks.

It's not like someone in Italy is going to look at your Old Navy chinos (or what have you) and point and laugh. Note: I've traveled all over Italy many times and even lived there for a while. Most people in Italy do not attend Pitti Uomo annually.

Just get something that fits well. You could buy chinos from Target that are disposable the month after your trip that would work fine for a 2 week vacation. Not saying you should, just that assuming the fit is good it's not going to be visibly apparent to casual observers.

If you're looking for something that will last and look great beyond just this trip, I agree with J. Crew. I've been eyeing J. Press chinos lately, though they are at the upper end of your price range. I would not buy anything from Bonobos."

malefashionadvice,"See the clothes in person. I don't really like buying anything I haven't at least seen or touched in person before. Doesn't have to be during the shopping process or that exact item, but if I can't visualize in my mind what to expect beyond their photo, I'm less likely to order. 

If shopping sight unseen online, look at the return policy. Also as much as mall brands are basic and boring and whatever, there's something to be said for trusting that you're going to get that refund if you return the clothes.

I have an immediate distrust of any brand that doesn't provide photos of a human being wearing the clothes. Product photos should be zoomable and include at least one photo of a human model in that actual garment.

I also have a threshold of what I'm willing to spend for a given brand or type if item. I'll spend $200 on a nice pair of pants, shoes, or jacket from a brand I know. I'm not spending $200 on a shirt from CutesyBrandName Instagram Ad Dot Com without a lot of assurances from independent parties that they are really worth the cost."

Generally speaking, broken english, the ability to put in any number of any size, everything on sale, copy paste/weird about pages, no contact info, no listed street address(if it is double check to see if it isn’t a vacant lot or something), if it sells exclusively clothed from one brand, especially like a generic mall brand, it’s fake.

malefashionadvice,"&gt; If you want to dress exclusively for your wife that's cool, but clothes are like the only hobby where people can't seem to understand that people will do it for their own enjoyment.

No, I totally understand that. In fact, I specifically called that out in my post -- ""flattering"" vs. ""interesting."" Personal enjoyment is a great reason to buy clothes. You seem to be arguing with somebody that's not in this conversation.

At the same time, your appearance plays an important role in your relationship. Having a fancy computer won't make your partner swoon when you walk into a room, nor will a bad computer make them embarrassed to be seen with you. Your computer also won't affect the way your peers at work view you. All of these factors are perfectly valid reasons to wear certain clothes.

&gt; Wear clothes that make you happy. I feel like I'm taking crazy pills!

Friend, you're in a subreddit called *malefashionadvice*. People come here because they want to improve the way they present themselves socially. Clothes tell a story to the people around you.

malefashionadvice,"It’s up to you how much you want to spend. No one is going to think you look bad, if you show up in a cheap suit that fits okay, with a white shirt, a black tie, black socks, and black dress shoes. And I think it’s worth being clear that you don’t wear a suit to a wedding to look good, you do it to be respectful. You don’t even need black; charcoal, dark gray, and dark navy are still respectful and appropriate for the occasion, when paired with the right accessories. 

With that much time, you may find yourself in a stressful situation if you order online. You have to wait for delivery, hope that it fits well enough to be tailored, and then wait for it to be tailored (at a minimum, jacket length and pant length will almost certainly need to be adjusted). Buying in person will allow you to have a wearable suit much more quickly, especially if the store has a tailor. Men’s Wearhouse, Macy’s, Nordstrom, and local equivalents to MW are all good for that. J Crew and Charles Tyrwhitt are other chains that sell suits and (at least sometimes) have a tailor in house. 

Your disposable income matters as well. If you need to buy everything (suit, tie, shirt, shoes, socks) and $600 would represent several months worth of savings, don’t feel the need to spend more. If you put $2000 a month in savings and you like nice stuff, buying higher quality is a “might as well” situation. Even then, you still don’t *need* to spend $1200 on a suit."

malefashionadvice,"I wrote what I wrote in order to not end up writing a novel to some guy who just wants to know whether it's time to buy new pants or what. 

I'm happy to go into more detail.

When I gained weight in 2018, it was due to some major biological changes (big hormone fluctuations that are permanent) and also some big lifestyle changes (corporate office job vs. working in film production where I was getting in 15K+ steps per day just existing) that are also permanent. I suppose, if I had a time machine and/or had not chosen to make a big lifestyle change that year, I \*could\* weigh less right now. But that's not realistic, so my body is what it is at this point. I have found that learning to love who I am is much more healthy for me than developing an eating disorder in order to wear clothes with a different tag in them that nobody will ever see anyway. 

Could I undergo some kind of radical weight loss regimen via dieting and extreme exercise? I guess? This is something I've done a few times since 2018 with no dramatic effect. At best I can sustainably lose about 10 pounds, \*if\* I keep up the diet and exercise regimen. I like eating cake and seeing my child occasionally. They are more important to me than the achievement of clothes with a different tag in them that nobody will ever see anyway.

I am physically healthy, and my doctor is not concerned about my health or size. I am also fit enough to do most activities I want to do, buy straight sizes of clothes, sit in airplane seats, etc.

Calories in/calories out isn't a real thing, anyway. Like maybe if you weigh 400 lbs, have a severe bingeing disorder, and the solution to your health problems is to stop eating an entire bag of cheetos daily? But if you are a typical person with sensible eating habits, shaving off 200 calories isn't going to make a huge difference. The margin of error on food packaging, serving sizes, etc. is larger than most people cut via calorie restriction, anyway. This isn't to say nobody should watch what they eat, calorie restriction diets are 100% bad, etc. but in general the average person who is getting older, managing a busy life that doesn't have as much room for the gym as it used to, etc. is not going to dramatically change the size and shape of their body via a ""calories in, calories out"" approach. 

Nor should they feel pressure to. It is OK to take up space in this world. It is OK to exist, to eat a french fry every once in a while, to prioritize something that makes you happy over weight loss, and to buy bigger pants bc that's the size of pants you wear. 

Obviously if folks are medically unhealthy, need to get their eating, drinking, lifestyle etc. under control, and the like, yes, by all means go to the gym. Reduce the number of calories you eat (or whatever other diet). Striving to be healthier is amazing! Striving to make your body physically smaller for body image reasons or psychological reasons is not amazing!"

malefashionadvice,"Absolutely that's the issue, but &gt;$200 list price for poor quality cashmere is disappointing."
malefashionadvice,"I know you said under $200 but I cannot recommend the Brycelands one highly enough. Buy it once and wear it until you die. The fit, construction, and material are all top notch."
malefashionadvice,"&gt; After all, I'm not really looking to impress Gen Z.

This isn't rocket surgery. **_DRESS IN A WAY THAT MAKES YOU HAPPY!!!_**

If the current trends do not serve you or your life then DO NOT FOLLOW THEM. This also isn't a life-long commitment. Buy a pair of Levis' 501s and try them out! If you don't like them, it was a fun experiment with clothing that cost you all of [$80](https://www.levi.com/US/en_US/clothing/men/jeans/straight/501-original-fit-mens-jeans/p/005012333). Less if you do more than 2 seconds of googling. 

I can't believe I'm saying this but MFA is not doing a ""disservice"" by staying stuck on a trend that is almost a decade gone by now and instead staying with current trends."
malefashionadvice,That's that cheap cashmere.
malefashionadvice,"There is absolutely nothing wrong with liking or being more comfortable with a certain way of dressing. A lack of openness to *other people's* styles and preferences, or totally closing yourself off to new ways of dressing are the problems (Along with all the judgemental stuff)."
malefashionadvice,"Hasn't Bonobos been around for like 5-10 years, total? At least in the mainstream. 

I don't think they've gone down in quality, they just always sucked. Their whole thing has never been about quality. All their clothes look like they'll fall apart in 2 washes. And they always have."
malefashionadvice,Yeah not a huge fan of TB aesthetic so want to avoid that ultra cropped chunky shoe look (plus the white lines and little flags everywhere)
malefashionadvice,stop
malefashionadvice,"I'd say most of that is probably true.

malefashionadvice,"&gt; It also makes me wonder whether a bunch of other pcmasterrace/cycling/car guys have wives thoroughly unimpressed with their random hobby.

If you want to dress exclusively for your wife that's cool, but clothes are like the only hobby where people can't seem to understand that people will do it for their own enjoyment. 

It's a really weird gender thing imo. It's like really really accepted that guys should wear clothes only for dating/sex purposes. Obviously women face a lot of similar issues, but I never see any pushback about how just _weird_ it is that tons of men are spending crazy amounts of time, effort, and money on finding ""perfect jeans that will for sure get you laid"". Personal fulfillment and enjoyment be damned. 

&gt;my main goal is for my wife to think I'm hot

Do _you_ think you're hot?? Your wife clearly wants you to self-actualize and be confident in yourself. Wear clothes that _make you happy_. I feel like I'm taking crazy pills!"

malefashionadvice,"ALD when it began was very much a brand for guys who were wearing supreme jackets with j crew chinos and Jordan’s. It’s sort of the poster child for “grown man streetwear” aka clothes for a sneaker head who has an office job. There’s an old picture of Teddy Santis wearing a blue OCBD and dark wash jeans trying to decide between a pair of Jordan 1s and kill shots that kind of sums up the concept. 

They have big ties and Teddy is a fan of supreme as well as being close to Ronny Fieg of Kith. 

Now a days, ALD has become shorthand for Neo-prep (the workwear-heritage prep-streetwear blend that arose in like 2019). Lots of incorporation of basketball, running, takes on iconic workwear jackets like Carhartt detroits or ll bean barn coats as well as fleeces, flannels, upscale sweatsuits and track wear. 

But currently I would say that ALDs design ethos are a lot more similar to Ralph Lauren’s NYC style pinstripe suiting than it’s prep beginnings . It’s more in tune with menswear but with a italian-meets urban styling that’s drawing on more Italian/Greek immigrant styling of the 70s and 90s."
malefashionadvice,"Newfoundland is what I'm thinking, they're apparently a 10/10 slob-fest but they look so cute"

malefashionadvice,I wouldn’t say they’re classically good looking either since they’re more akin to the slim fit popular in the 2010s. Traditional fits are in the middle of that and the oversized look popular today

malefashionadvice,"The relationship between Succession and it's impact on real phenomena like fashion is a very interesting one. What started out as (and still is) a satire of the ultra-wealthy is now driving business for brands associated with the ultra-wealthy. 

The attention to detail on the show is immense, and it's apparent in the clothes the characters wear very well. Kendall is a vapid and insecure billionaire, so he wears the most expensive pieces from the hottest designers. Logan, also a billionaire, confident in his status goes for more reasonably priced and much less hyped (but still very well made) grandpa clothes. Greg, only recently having been elevated from relative poverty wears deck shoes to work for having spent all his money on his suit, and Tom, someone used to wealth berates him for it. 

With all this in mind it's no wonder succession with its commentary on contemporary society (including fashion) is now actually influencing fashion itself. But for it to drive sales for those ultra-luxury brands it showcases feels kind of ironic in regards to the core ideas of the show"

malefashionadvice,"What, specifically, is the issue that can't be solved with good merino wool socks? Overheating? Merino wool is typically temperature regulating. What brands have you tried?"
malefashionadvice,"Yeah I’ve def called this out before too, a lot of the “advice” from these people is unironically “don’t be ugly”, and a bunch of shitty body ideals, considering no one can even keep the takes straight(you can find one person saying skinny people need to wear skinny jeans to match their proportions and one person saying skinny people can’t wear skinny jeans because they make their legs look too small lol), I don’t see a point in good faith arguments there. It’s why I have a broader issue with the concept of telling people something is or isn’t “flattering”, it’s almost always a meaningless thought provoking cliche to stop people from enjoying clothing as a hobby with a writeup attached of all the persons flaws with their body. I’m so good on basing how I dress around a reddit lurkers idea of traditional attraction.

And yeah, it’s fs already mainstream with women and, funnily enough, despite lurkers insistence that you’ll look like a clown with looser fits and you need to wear spray on denim for people to think you’re attractive, ime especially among gen z, there’s a lot of jokes from women about how much they dislike guys wearing skinny jeans lol.

&gt;I feel like the bulk of these comments are coming from out of touch 30 year olds. 

Yes.

Idk I just hate how for some reason fashion is the one hobby on this sub that you’re just allowed to openly mock and ridicule both the hobby and the people interested with zero good faith attempts to at least understand why people like it. Genuinely people are more open to believing and understanding NoFap or other incel adjacent pua subs(what’s with shit take lurkers always having a million post in that Corey Wayne sub or whatever?) than people just liking a slightly different way of dressing as them."

malefashionadvice,"Been asked four times in the office why I was dressed so nice. Literally just wearing Olive Military style pants, blue patterned button up, and Brown Iron Rangers. As basic as it gets. Not even WAYWT-worthy. 

Hate working with people who think a polo and jeans is “dressing up for the office”. Makes it hard to put interest/care into my outfits because it stands out so much."

malefashionadvice,Thanks! I found it. It's a Prada Windbreaker.
malefashionadvice,"Loro Piana does a better job than the rest of the brands you mention and really deserve to be lauded for their extreme attention to detail, unmatched materials, vertical integration of all steps of design and production, quality control, and even technical innovation (like their crazy good waterproof wool). To call LP generic just shows you’re misinformed. There’s a reason hip designers across the spectrum from streetwear to high fashion laud and wear the brand. Listen to the recent Blamo podcast and hear 424’s founder gosh about the brand. 

They are “good” designs as much as anything is since that is a subjective term. I appreciate LP much more than many of the brands lauded here. 

It would be funny if it wasn’t so eye-rollingly hypocritical that this mean girl group of 10-15ish regulars who love to whine about lurkers and gnash teeth over anyone expressing a divergent opinion feel the need to lambaste LP and share such acclaimed opinions as it doesn’t look “cool” or has “no taste”. The same people who castigate others for “negativity” or “not adding to the conversation”."

Like, just wear the clothes."
malefashionadvice,"Hate isn’t the word I’d use but I’m not a fan either. People name dropping LP, Cuccenilli, Zenga, Kiton, etc. just screams having money but no taste or opinion of oneself visually. 

Good design should have an actual perspective and the above brands make very expensive generic wear. Your paying a high retail price to sit on the fence or blend in. The same way I feel ALD is preying on a generation that aged out of Supreme, these brands are selling the stealth wealth, Sillicon Valley chic angle.

malefashionadvice,"A very specific annoyance that I have is the implied heteronormativity of how a body *should* look in clothes. For example, short men *can't* wear wide fits or, the alternative, that a larger man *obviously* looks better in wide fits (But a slimmer man does not). It's all very strange and laden with naturalized/essentialized assumptions of what a person *should* look like.

My partner is non-binary and, especially on days where they feel dysphoric, feel most comfortable with large wool pants or large pleated skirt, a big sweater, and a shawl. Linen/silk equivalents for the summer (They are a master thrifter and have lots of dope items). I feel like people should have that option to go drapey without being ridiculed or judged for it.

Also, (At least at the University campus I'm working at) young women are pretty much universally embracing wider fits. I have found that it is usually only a matter of time before men follow whatever trend women start. I've seen some guys in the comments here mention that women do this because they ""chase trends"" while guys don't and I actually exploded a little bit. I feel like the bulk of these comments must be coming from out of touch 30 years old. At the very least, casual MFA users prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that toxic masculinity is alive and well."

Question is: can exposed ankle work style wise with specifically black shoes like an Oxford captoe? How about a whole cut? I have tried going bare ankle with black monkstrap and it looks ok due to the casual nature of the monkstrap. Curious about the dressier shoes.

malefashionadvice," ""The original ""sawtooth"" shirt was developed by Jack A. Weil. Jack was actually the inventor of the Western shirt design.

He wanted cowboys to wear more striking and handsome style shirts, but keep some normality to the design.

For those who aren't familiar with who Jack A. Weil is, you may know his brand Rockmount Ranch Wear. Jack patented the sawtooth design pocket flaps and diamond snap buttons, the name ""sawtooth"" from what the cult historians have said was actually from the jagged stitching on the pockets and yoke, which resembled ""sawteeth"".

With large thighs, pants labeled wide could be slim on you, and “slim fit” pants might be painted on.

Once they decide that, they’ll have to figure out what clothes accomplish it.

But it sounds like you’re saying you don’t buy slim fit clothes because they don’t fit you well, that’s kind of unrelated to the writer’s point about drape etc."

malefashionadvice,"&gt;Every body is different.

Correct, and a lot of slim fit clothing fits people with a lean and/or muscular physique. Not to menti0on the variance within brands of what slim fit means.

Basically, find your slim fit brand and stick with it. For me, Tommy slim fit polos fit like a glove. Levi 511's fit like a glove. Slim fit done right is simply a regular piece of clothing with with a slimmer cut and silhouette that tapers to the body and doesn't hang or fold everywhere.

So I reiterate my point: that article is not only (like most fashion articles written by self-proclaimed fashion gurus) pretentious, but it is misleading and lumps every skinny and narrow piece of clothing under the ""slim fit"" umbrella. There are many good examples of slim fit clothing. Fact."

The thing about wool trousers is that they can be dressed down to casual (e.g., with a casual shirt), work perfectly for business casual (e.g., with a sport coat and casual shirt), and can be dressed up to semi-formal (e.g., with a conservative sport coat, dress shirt, and tie).

If you lose weight and add muscle in the chest and shoulders, the tux will be loose in the waist but less loose in the chest and shoulders; that will make it much less likely that a tailor will be unable to fix it."

malefashionadvice,"I agree, it's hard to define what makes something slim or skinny when everyone and their favourite clothing brand has their own idea of it. I find myself using the terms interchangeably, because it's the concept I'm against, not any particular expression. 

You could argue my straight fit jeans are slim, because the leg opening isn't actually very large, and there's far wider pants out there. But after a decade or more of slim fit supremacy, brands have taken to selling pants that cling to your skin as slim instead of skinny, so calling the straight fit jeans slim now seems misguided."

Specify what you mean by ""fit."" Roomy clothing fits, wide fits fit. There have been multiple decades where that was the consensus too. 

Steve McQueen's clothing was pretty outdated for much of the 80s through the mid 2010s when MFA embraced that vintage slim fit look, and now it's leaving. If you think that was ""timeless"" you're kidding yourself lol. 

Just be honest and say you like slim fit 2010s trends even if they're outdated. Don't lie and say they're on trend lol, or even lamer, that it's ""timeless."" That shit is just marketing used to sell any trend, and those trends will go out of fashion too, just like the lumberjack 2010s look you're hanging on to now."

While not for everyone, the slim suit upgraded the “too much fabric” or “sack” effect of men’s suits and allowed Gen X and under to look different then their older colleagues. The Ludlow suit is iconic for a reason. I like that now American males dress like an EU parliamentarian rather than an insurance salesman in Boise. On the other hand, for the right body, Armani’s sumptuous cuts and fabrics are about to have a major moment again so looking forward to seeing how some men move into a softer silhouette."

malefashionadvice,"Butler’s suit was a big swing, not sure if it fully connected but the combination of big stylistic choices (color, the cut on the vest) and the flared tailoring at the shoulders, wrists and ankles created a memorable look.  It might just be a little too much with the color.

Calvo’s jacket and tie were perfect, and the overall look showed how a more relaxed fit can flatter rather than distract.

Krasinki looked good, conservative, mature, but everything more or less exactly right.

White, Woodall, Mescal went overboard with the oversized look, they belong at the 2003 NBA draft, not a 2023 awards show.  Sharp and Keoghan were closer to the mark, even if Keoghan’s jacket was a bit overdone.

I can appreciate what Redmayne was going for, and think his vaguely alien look allows for him to dress attractively across gender norms (sort of male Tilda Swinton), but that blouse had some proportion issues, I’m not sure who would look good in that if he can’t pull it off."

malefashionadvice,"yeah it was always there in some form. 

If you're refering to bottoms only, I navigated in european indie / punk / emo scenes 20 years ago and people were ditching baggy everything for straight cuts with a low rise and a lack of taper. I think I started seeingactual slim / skinny fits among younger hip people in their early 20s around 2008 or so. 

The tops, though, were already slim by the early 00s. I was a bigger guy at the time and I had a hard time adjusting to the skinny shirt trend. I clearly kept on wearing XL 90s tshirts for quite sometime, because I did not feel confident enough to wear anything tighter. 

But I was happy when slim jeans were becoming more available at the end of the decade because straight fits of the late 90s and early 00s never fit me right, and that was either this or baggy / relaxed pants. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not sure where we're going, but as a 40-something it would be ridiculous at this point to put on high waisted pleats with paraboots, especially considering it's what my father's generation used to wear, more or less, so it feels super weird. Wider shirts ? Better for me. Baggy pants ? I already know I'll look like shit in them, I already did back then. I'll stick to somewhat tapered pants for a while. More power to those who try on different things though, but mostly, you gotta wear what makes you look good, regardless of trend."

malefashionadvice,"I underside that we’re eschewing slim fits but I can’t help but notice that some of these suits didn’t look like they fit their wearers well. Like some of the outfits remind me of “little brother wearing big brother’s clothes”. 

I guess I’m showing my bias when I think the most “traditional” or conservative of the outfits looked the best (Garfield’s and Krasinski’s) but I will say that Redmayne’s outfit looked well tailored and fit him well (but not my style).

But for the others, it’s stuff like all the bunching/folding and pleating in the fabric (on the sleeves) that makes it look sloppy to me. 

Austin Butler’s arms look weird in the Gucci suit.

Will Sharpe’s suit look like the tailor completely messed up. The body is taken in so much that it makes him look like he has curves but the arms of the suit and shirt are too long."

One counterpoint to consider, though, is that in a sub called ""male fashion advice"" I'd expect most people are actually open to updating or even starting a new wardrobe. And if that is the case, economically/sustainably speaking, it's the worst time to invest more into slim fits as you'd get the least utility from it as the trend is waning.

That said I generally agree with you. At this point the casual pieces I'm updating my closet with are roomier fits. But I work in a slightly young and fashionable corporate office, which means stuff like slim blazers and jeans will still serve me well for the office for a few years."

Even something like a Thom Brown Suit is made to accentuate aspects of the wearer..."
malefashionadvice,"I'm in Europe and I already see that lol. I live in a fairly fashionable city with lots of universities and corporate offices, which means most of Gen Z have already abandoned slim fits, and interestingly it means that corporate offices are more ahead of the curve than American offices and that means 40-60 year old professionals (people who in the US would still be wearing conservative pleated loose suits) are mostly in slim fits. LOTS of 40+ and even 50+ year olds in slim or skinny dark jeans, Vejas or Stan Smiths, a white dress shirt, and a slim navy blazer in my office. 

Which, imo, is better than the average corporate schlub looking like Saul Goodman. But it brings up your point that is THIS is the demographic mainly pushing slim fit (formerly fashionable millennial to Gen-X dads who are one entire fashion cycle behind), that is NOT the demo that sets trends. It's fine to be one if you want, nothing wrong with it.

But it WAS the upcoming trend, which some subcultures had adapted (indie, punk, emo, hipsters) and more importantly designers were beginning to go all in on it the way designers now are starting to go in on wide fits which haven't filtered down to most of the unfashionable masses yet.

We're at the point where the tides are visibly turning in the mainstream fashion industry.

malefashionadvice,"I think you’ll be fine, maybe on the edge of it being too big.  The tailor will be table to take in the jacket and pants enough that it shouldn’t matter that much.  

I wouldn’t recommend cutting back on a diet/exercise program that’s working for you out of concern for how your suit fits.  Let your tailor get the suit as close as possible to perfect and keep getting fitter, you’ll feel better in your skin and improve your posture, so you’ll look better anyway."
malefashionadvice,"I feel like people consistently conflate slim fits with low-rise skinny fits.  There is such thing as a middle ground.

malefashionadvice,"How tall are you?  Under 6 feet figure something like an inch off your waist for every 10lb you lose, 20-30lb for each jacket size.  So, if you lose another 10-15, your tailor can almost certainly work around the weight loss.  If you lose another 30lb, you’ll probably want to get a different suit.   If you’re a taller guy the weight distribution will be different.

Of course, the more weight you lose the better you’ll fit into off the rack stuff.  If you’re at a 50 or higher in your jacket size, there’s much less out there, once you get to 46/48, the number of options expands massively."
malefashionadvice,"Making big changes in my wardrobe. The more I see wide, boxy silhouettes, the more I like them, and the more I want to move in that direction. I picked up these two pairs of trousers:

Been wearing the Muji trousers with the Chucks, and I haven't felt this good and fashionable in ages. I've grown quite tired of my literal uniform of white t-shirt, brown leather jacket, jeans, and oxblood Red Wings. I feel inspired now to try new things, and try new colours, silhouettes, and get out of my comfort zone.

No idea what to wear with the Carhartts in Wax, at least upper body wise. I have some black Vans sk8-his that I think will look good, but won't get to try until I go back home."

malefashionadvice,"I'm getting married in mid May.  About a month ago I got measured for a custom tux.  At that time my weight was 275 lbs.  I've been dieting and exercising and now I'm down to 265, and hope to lose more by the wedding.  I will have multiple opportunities to have the tux tailored, but how much weight can I lose before the tux won't be able to be taken in and still look good?  Thanks!"
malefashionadvice,"Slim fit versus a more “forgiving” look will always be age and body type dependent.  When men feel comfortable wearing garments that accentuate the body shape, I suggest they do so.  When a man is not comfortable with his body type, then he’ll go for a more relaxed look.

More, I’m just encouraging of anyone who will put some thought into proper fit and style for his image he wants to convey.  At my age, and my body type, I’ve settled on items that FIT my height and weight, and I’m average in every single way.  6’0”, 190lbs, athletic but declining with age (47)."
malefashionadvice,"Looking for some new T Shirts. I love my old, extremely worn cotton shirts, but I've lost a considerable amount of weight recently (hopefully it stays off lol), so all of my shirts are way too big now. I like solid colors, and prefer them to be somewhat athletic fit but not athletic material. I have the proof 72 hr merino polos, and they fit and feel great, but I don't really want to spend $70 per tee. They don't have to be the most amazing things ever, just want to upgrade from your typical adidas shirts. Thanks!"

Personally I couldn’t pull off the old boxy, and baggy suits. I don’t have the body type to pull it off. It looks like I am drowning in my suit. 

Same with jeans. I never did the super skinny jeans cause it was too uncomfortable, but a nice taper or slim cut I can pull off with my body type, and am comfortable wearing. 

Sweaters and hoodies I am more than fine with loose fits.

The one I keep seeing with the younger crowd at the gym though are super short shorts and an oversized tshirt … and high top Nike blazers. Applicable for both men and women."
malefashionadvice,"&gt; I don’t know why this subreddit has such a hard time admitting that your body shape is the primary determinant in how you should dress.

I also definitely don't remember slim fits being in for two decades. Slim/skinny jeans were only in for about 11-12 years (my recollection is they started to take over in 2008/2009 when I was in school, and they were out of trend by 2020).

I also think Covid played a big role in hastening the transition, so that's one reason looser fits could be on trend for longer."
malefashionadvice,"&gt;To say a certain type of clothing looks “good” without any context of time and place doesn’t really make sense.

Good thing I’m talking about fit, not clothing types.   Slim fit will never look good on some people and wider fit will never look good on other people. 

There is “fashion” in the sense of looking presentable and put together, and there’s “fashion” in the sense of making some sort of artistic statement. I’m talking about the former."

Do you guys have any recommendations similar to the Stan Smith Recon? It's basically white leather sneakers with thick soles. I also would want a budget alternative, but you can go ahead and recommend anything if you have something in mind. Any suggestions?

Here's the link to the said product: [https://www.adidas.com/us/stan-smith-recon-shoes/H06185.html](https://www.adidas.com/us/stan-smith-recon-shoes/H06185.html)"
malefashionadvice,"&gt; Jeans weren’t low rise in the 90’s unless you were a college girl and even that was very late 90’s into the 2000’s.

Being in high school in the early 00s, sitting in the back of the class you'd just see a sea of thongs sticking out atop the low rise jeans of all the girls. Distracting times for a teenager.


The pants fit ""stages"" I actively remember were wide 'skater' jeans from the mid 90s until about 2002/2003. After that bootcut jeans with a slimmer top block were popular for about 3 years, then came the slim and skinny jeans."

malefashionadvice,"&gt; I'd argue that slim fits stayed as popular as they did because more people are in better shape and slimmer fits reward the people who are fit.

malefashionadvice,"I also prefer no stretchiness in jeans. Have you checked out Japanese makers? Best jeans i've ever owned are from a Japanese denim maker who did a special line for J Crew. I got them used on Poshmark, practically new, think I only paid ~$20. 2 years later, worn once a week, going strong, look and fit great."
malefashionadvice,You make good points.
malefashionadvice,"Interesting, thanks for looking that up"
malefashionadvice,"It's understandable, but slim fit can be just as unflattering on muscle as on fat. Save showing your hot bod for the beach, homie."
malefashionadvice,"It's interesting seeing this topic framed this way (""flattering"" vs. ""interesting""). I've tried on a few wider fits lately, and when I ask my wife what she thinks, she'll say something like, ""Wear whatever you like, but you look a lot better in slim fits."" 

I'm interested in fashion, but to be honest, my main goal is for my wife to think I'm hot. It makes it tough to get too far into this trend. It also makes me wonder whether a bunch of other malefashionadvice guys have wives thoroughly unimpressed with their baggy trousers."
malefashionadvice,That would be perfect. I have Large thighs. Thank you
malefashionadvice,"That made me chuckle, thanks!"
malefashionadvice,I think this explains why a lot of the times when I see posts here my reaction is “wtf is that”
malefashionadvice,"That is very true, but also fashion definitely doesn't give a shit about what the wider person likes unfortunately."
malefashionadvice,"I think there is a lot of mixing of trends/words here. ""slim"" fits haven't really been fashionable for over a decade if not fifteen years even. ""skinny"" was what was trendy when this sub got its footing, and people of normal body sizes purchased ""slim"" garments to approximate the ""skinny"" look. Slim is basically just removal of excess fabric/pleats, whereas skinny is actually fitted to the specific shape of someones body."
malefashionadvice,Would someone be so kind to link some pictures differentiating the two styles? After so long time of skinny I find it hard to know what regular fit is.

Anybody know what kinda shirt/jacket this is? Where can I find a cheaper version? I really like the size of the collar and the shoulders😌"
malefashionadvice,"Yeah, I’ll stick with my slim-straights and skinnies man. I got thin legs and a narrow torso. Anything “wide cut” makes me look like I walked out of Minecraft. 

Wear what you want and don’t worry about what the trends are."
malefashionadvice,"You might look into Moulded Shoe, a specialist store in NYC. I spoke to the owner in person, but I believe a lot of his business is remote. 

Chelseas or loafers might be tough. If you get shoes without laces, you’re kinda sorta saying “fuck it” to how well they fit, because laces do a great job of modifying the relationship between your foot and the shoe. If your foot matches the last of the shoe it should fit well, but it’s hard to imagine that your feet — with all of the things that make them unique — are close to the “average” foot the shoes are designed for."
malefashionadvice,I ordered a crewneck that ended up too big for me. Is shrinking it in hot water a good idea? I’m worried about the proportions and the print possibly getting ruined.
malefashionadvice,Long time lurker first time commenter. The slim/athletic fits are probably responsible for more returns than any recent trend. There are slim fit pants I’ve bought that fit and some of the same dimensions that do not. I don’t get it and maybe that’s why I’m on this sub.
malefashionadvice,"Footwear recommendations question. (Mobile formatting)

My feet are different sizes, with my left being a 10.5, right a 9.5 and both are 4E width and a wide toe box. I need some arch support too as my feet are not flat. I have tremendous issues finding comfortable shoes in the form of boots and dress shoes, and am tired of my feet being rubbed raw from wearing size 11.5. (Cant find 4E) 

For style preference, I like the look of chelsea boots, kiltie loafers, perforated full or semi oxford, and think monk strap shoes look cool, but I absolutely cannot fit anything with a pointed toe. 

I would really appreciate any advice guys"
malefashionadvice,"Yeah, I thought that was the reason but the stretch material always makes clothes shrink so damn much. Whatever stretch you get is undone by the shrinkage. Feel it makes everything cheaper and shittier. I’m currently wearing jeans with stretch in them and desperately looking for ones that don’t. Wrangler seems to be the only brand that you can find regular non-high end non stretch jeans left."
malefashionadvice,Jeans weren’t low rise in the 90’s unless you were a college girl and even that was very late 90’s into the 2000’s. Girls used to wear their jeans with the button opened. That was the first time I had seen it out on Main Street. Low rise for men came much later. I think you mean medium rise.

malefashionadvice,So you’re saying that we might see older men in low-rise skinny jeans 15 years from now? That will be hilarious. Probably true.
malefashionadvice,"Playing it close to the chest, huh"
malefashionadvice,I mean yes that is generally going to be the case lol
malefashionadvice,"I can't say I think that wash is very on trend right now. Trends are comprised of more than just cut. Jeans in the 1990s were mostly low rise, while this time around high-rise pants are heavily in style, both in jeans and other pants. Chinos and their variants (fatigues) weren't much of a thing I want to say in the 1990s, but currently are just as big, if not bigger, than denim. Raw hems and crops are also popular right now, which I don't think was very popular in the 1990s.

This doesn't speak to the other elements of the current trend, but there is far more than just cut to trends.  Also [heres James Deen](https://media.vogue.fr/photos/5c361dd20181d6057d9aa4ba/master/w_2580%2Cc_limit/gettyimages_74260477_jpg_246.jpg?lang=eng) wearing jeans in a similar wide cut in the 1950s, so maybe we should say wide fit is a 1950s trend? That's ignoring the wider cuts that rotated in and out of style through the entire 20th century."
malefashionadvice,I like the look of the Mac coat in 2 more.
malefashionadvice,"Probably because many 45+ guys have escaped the fashion samsara and have achieved endadcorement, and have only been wearing relaxed fit all this time because they wore that in their youth.

In the same way, many people will continue to wear slim fit forever, because it was still in when they stopped caring.

Therefore it’s not wrong to say that the trend is now driven by Z, because they rediscovered it on their own and are the ones pushing it."
malefashionadvice,I have some suits from Nordstrom that I purchased in 2003 which were just the “normal” cut and they are insanely loose/wide. I don’t remember the early 200”’s being that baggy but the certainly were. Super baggy with pleats.
malefashionadvice,The solution is to not support brands known to be using children for their labor.
malefashionadvice,The underlying subtext here that affordable brands automatically = child labor?
malefashionadvice,Spier &amp; Mackay has them.
malefashionadvice,"I take your point but I'm not certain I agree. In the 2000s there was absolutely a pretty mainstream opinion that it was unmanly to wear any pants that were slim enough to see any sort of outlines of your legs. ""Metrosexual"" started to get thrown around a lot for any guy who basically showed any interest in their clothes not fitting like a burlap sack."
malefashionadvice,"This is an incredible post, thank you so much for this. ive been trying to wrap my head around getting into fashion with not much money to spare so im constantly going back and forth on what to buy and this is rly helpful i especially appreciate the fact that u included some yt channels to tune into aswell"
malefashionadvice,Are you drying on a medium or low heat? Drying on high heat tends to ruin modern fabrics.
malefashionadvice,"Because 3-piece suits are an uncommon and very showy type of suit. You can hem and haw about its origins but 99% (probably more) of suits worn don't have the matching vest. It doesn't say ""this is my work uniform"", it screams ""YES I AM WEARING A SUIT I AM VERY INTO THIS SUIT""

&gt;So double breasted suits, pinstripe or chalk stripe suits, three piece suits, single breasted with peak lapels, subtle windowpane or houndstooth fabric in any conservative shade of blue, grey, black, green or brown.

Yes, those are also showy. Green or brown? Yeah dude that's gonna get some weird looks in the office.

Source: Lawyer, late 30s, been wearing suits for most of my career. In an office where suits are the norm wearing a chalkstripe or a 3-piece or a **green** suit (lol) is going to get you looks because there you're dressing for a dress code, not a wedding. Leave the green suits and the 3-piece suits for the garden party."
malefashionadvice,"I actually buy basically all my clothes (except underwear and socks) secondhand, so that's not a problem at all — actually a bonus as long as it's in good condition. The problem is just the lack of availability of matching jackets/pants since a lot of people don't buy the matching sets together when they're new."
malefashionadvice,"It's not even about ""the masses"" it's simply that dress codes, even implicit ones, exist. Going too casual is a thing, but going too formal is also a thing, and will make you stick out and people may treat you differently for better or worse. How you dress sends a message."

malefashionadvice,"I know this isn't the most actionable advice, but give it some time. It's fine if you need to take a break from the apps to just focus on yourself a bit. Remember that alcohol and food can make you feel better in the short term, but it won't fill the void in the long term, and isn't something to keep doing (I'm not knocking you - we've all been there). If you can, try to channel the energy into more productive efforts like exercise, finding a new hobby, or revisiting an old hobby. 

I'll repeat what I said before because it's still true, and I still mean it: It's okay that things didn't work out; don't mourn the potential of what might've been, and don't get stuck in the past. Instead, try to see this as being one step closer to finding the right person. I promise you, they're out there!"

I've been here. It's tough, but work toward taking dates off a pedestal. If every time you get a date it's this huge life defining moment for you,   you'll try too hard and get too invested.

It's not a work meeting, man. If someone wants to talk, throw out a ""coffee on Thursday?"" Keep lowkey chats lowkey."
malefashionadvice,"Today's wide-fit trend is not the same as the 90s wide-fit trend, the current trend is in some ways inspired by the 90s trend but they are not the same. Nor is the same as the wide fits trends of the 50s or 70s, though it also draws from them."
malefashionadvice,Why is everyone saying that Z is driving this trend? People 45 and older never stopped wearing relaxed fit from the 90’s up until now. Z is only trying to steal the look from Gen X. It belongs to X.
malefashionadvice,"No one's saying it wasn't a good idea, people are only saying it's a dying trend. Something most of the sub is in denial about"

malefashionadvice,"&gt; Hi let me introduce myself ... I have zero knowledge in fashion.

Welcome to MFA! You're in the right place to learn about how to dress. [This](https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/5da1xt/building_a_basic_wardrobe_v60/) and [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/5da1dc/the_basic_bastard_basic_wardrobe_and_inspiration/) and [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/11aw4xa/the_simple_someone_a_basic_bastard_inspired_album/) are great posts to read/look at if you're just starting out. 

&gt; My kinda shopping always will be like I go to a Store I just pick some solid Colours and come back. I feel this really hurts me and breaks my confidence because I think I'm too early for the formal dress code stuff

Don't worry too much about wearing just solid colors. Your confidence in your clothes will grow as you build your wardrobe and learn how to put outfits together, but it's a slow process.

&gt;I always think low of me i think so because of the dress code.

Is there a specific dress code you need to dress for? Or are you just looking for day-to-day casual clothing?

&gt; Kindly suggest some colours that are apt for dark skinned guy.

Skin tone doesn't matter a ton when it comes to choosing colors... some folks might say that some colors like jewel tones or yellow look better against dark skin, because they can make pale skin look washed out, but honestly it's not worth worrying about too much. The more important thing is that the colors of your clothes work together.

Feel free to post more questions in the Daily Questions thread as you're building your wardrobe - I'd also recommend checking out the ""best X for $X"" spreadsheet [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mhOIpjUUibBf3QueJs8iRJy5gBKCILq82ekJkiC5uqQ/edit#gid=0) (and the linked discussion threads) for item-specific needs."
malefashionadvice,"It isn’t the slim that always bothered most of the population. It’s the low-rise skinny fit. That never looked good on anyone. 

Medium to high rise slim/straight will always be ok especially in menswear because it fits."
malefashionadvice,"Lol if you're old enough to remember Seinfeld then you should remember the era when skinny or slim pants were thought to accentuate your shortness/smallness and made you look ""gay"". It's ironic now that those same people (you) are now just on the opposite outdated trend."
malefashionadvice,"I mean, there were also short people in the many decades clothing was more relaxed or even baggy, and they were absolutely not justifying sticking with outdated clothing because of their body type"
malefashionadvice,"It's no more pretentious than the last 10 years of this sub that has been preaching slim as inherently more ""timeless"" or ""flattering"" (less so, in fact)"
malefashionadvice,"&gt; It would be more honest to admit when you're swimming with or against the stream than being in denial about it either way.

The thing is the slim fit proponents in this sub are in denial. They're the only ones talking about ""timeless"" this and that"
malefashionadvice,"Bro athletic people have worn roomier fits for decades, and that was the preferred fit for that body type for most of your life. In fact jocks were the last people to adopt the slim fit trend lol. People will argue that [body type] is better served by [insert any trend here] let's not pretend your preference is any more valid for that body type than any other when people have said that slimmer fits or very roomy fits are also flattering on those body types too (including in this thread!)"
malefashionadvice,"Unfortunately every item is listed as stretch denim. 

I’m telling ya this is a pervasive issue. I spent a long day at multiple department stores and shops checking out new jeans and everything feels like god damned spandex."
malefashionadvice,People said slim pants also weren't flattering or even masculine clothing for about 20 years before slim fit came in. If you are old enough to remember cargo shorts and flip flops then you are in denial of an era where slim clothing was considering so unflattering it made people doubt your sexuality. Let's not pretend like these aren't all just after-the-fact social justifications that just get applied to justify [insert current trend]
malefashionadvice,"You may, and I appreciate it, but those cuts are just not my thing."
malefashionadvice,"The 50s-60s-70s in many subcultures from black culture to SHARPs to punk to formal clothing. The 80s and early 90s and even 00s had some too in some ways (look at mod influence, Euro brands like Diesel, indie/emo era..."
malefashionadvice,"I actually think it has more to do with the lack of quality control in mass produced clothing. 

By having some amount of tolerance in what “fits” they don’t need to be as precise in their sizing. 

Plus, I assume, these materials are cheaper and lead to higher margins."
malefashionadvice,Reasons
malefashionadvice,Congrats you made a comment that was last valid in 2012
malefashionadvice,Meanwhile there is a comment in this thread saying America is probably fitter than it was 10 years ago and that's why we should stick with slim fit lol
malefashionadvice,"Bro America is fatter than ever lol wtf is this ""in shape"" shit. 

All this talk about whatever trend you like being more objectively flattering is arbitrary subjectiveness, the same jsutification was used for the opposite trend too. Back when slim fit started coming around it was made fun of for being effeminate and unflattering and unmanly. Now the conservatives are saying slim fit is flattering and manly. It goes both ways, it's all just made up bullshit to justify the aging trend you are holding on to"
malefashionadvice,"Still though, let's not pretend the people digging in their conservative heels on slim fit are doing so because they see it as the next big trend. The fact that they've refused to adapt to the current relaxed fit trend the last 3-4 years as its grown is evidence that it's not being ahead of the curve they care about, they're just behind"

Do these look ok together?"
malefashionadvice,Everybody is a body builder on reddit apparently.
malefashionadvice,lol nah. Slim fit also ruled the roost for about 15 years. The people refusing to get off it now because they think it will be right back any minute now are probably hunkering down at the worst possible time right now.
malefashionadvice,"As a white dude millennial in decent shape and fairly aware, I just *can’t* with the relaxed fit. I feel like I’m trying to be open and I look at all the looks posted here or in similar forums, and it’s just not for me. I’ve definitely gotten a little more relaxed fit in general over the past 5-10 years but the wider cuts on pants and jackets just looks so sloppy and uncomfortable to me. I did wide leg jeans in middle school and I just can’t go back haha. I get not doing 00s skinny jean cuts for sure, but I got for straight or slim cut pants at every chance. 

Also I notice that most ads I see for men’s suiting/dress clothing is still slim oriented unless it’s meant to be a fashion piece. I kinda can’t see that going away especially since millennials are finally hitting that stride where our quantity + buying power influences what’s in stores. At least I hope it’s true cause I’d die if I had to buy a JNCO suit.

Also, I’d like to caveat that my thoughts generally only apply to myself. I think I’d have opinions on other folks wearing it but I try to temper it and remember I wore skinny jeans back in the day. It’s just been hard to see it executed in a way I think I’d like on myself."

Also - to be clear: suits aren't worn in ""color combos."" A suit is when the jacket and pants are cut from the same fabric and are thus the same color. You're not in a suit if you're wearing a different color jacket and pants."
malefashionadvice,Pretty stupid and close minded article. Why not just dress the way that you like to dress? Also why limit yourself to any type of fit. Sometimes I like slim fit jeans and other times I like baggy jeans. Depends on the outfit. Sometimes I want skin tight clothes and other times I want loose flowing clothes. Sometimes I wear a combination of the two. Who the fuck cares lol just wear what you want and what you think looks good.
malefashionadvice,Tiktok/influencers/models wearing them
malefashionadvice,If anything is timeless it's regular fit 501s lmao
malefashionadvice,a good lesson that is never worth it to share anything
malefashionadvice,Look for the Baggies on secondhand sites or worn wear. Also Patagonia has several colors of baggies on sale currently. While $65 is a lot for some casual shorts they do have a lifetime guarantee.
malefashionadvice,"it's the classic relaxed-fit chino pant. i highly recommend, especially for larger thighs 👍"
malefashionadvice,"had to look it up but seems the rebrand started in 2017 and sales etc started bouncing back in 2019.

malefashionadvice,"Nice job. It’s just as valid as what that person originally wrote. I think we should all wear what we feel good in and what looks good on us, not what is “in” or “out”. If clothing is a form of self-expression as this sub  seems to think, then pursuing trends because of reasonably compelling online articles is surely anathema to that."
malefashionadvice,Yes you’ll look great and true to your username! Hope the date goes well.
malefashionadvice,"Is a gray cable knit sweater, black jeans, and black chelsea boots fine for a casual coffee date?"
malefashionadvice,That isn't what I'm saying
malefashionadvice,Yep! Sorry for no link.
malefashionadvice,"It's for fat people. Not shaming, but the fatter the population gets, the more they want their clothes to last through their weight fluctuations, and so the stretchy-er clothing gets overall. Personally, I find that 1-3% spandex or elastane in pants is only noticeable in preventing fabric breakage in knees or other high-wear sections."
malefashionadvice,I think the look you see on red carpets by celebs with over zealous stylists with pants that are too long and loose below the knees is a horrible look.
malefashionadvice,"Lmao. You're saying a person isn't enjoying clothes the right way  because he doesn't enjoy drama?

When people talking about pretention and gatekeeping in hobbies they mean shit like this."
malefashionadvice,Late 60’s preppy and mod
malefashionadvice,Yeah. I found this to be a pretty pretentious article to be quite honest.
malefashionadvice,"That’s what always gets me, dudes make some massive deal about how everyone on the sub is wearing the most avant garde cutting edgr jnco shit and it’s literally just a pair of 501s lol"
malefashionadvice,"I love their washed oxfords so much that I have four different colors. Medium, slim, tall is my hyper-specific size and they are usually available on final sale for like $50. They look and fit great."
malefashionadvice,"I'm really confused by his example pictures because some look like they're still wearing pretty slim fitting pants, just straight cut."
malefashionadvice,Yeah I'd say that's a dress shirt. You would probably do better with something more casual but it sounds like the kind of look you're going for is something I don't have much experience with.
malefashionadvice,I've been pleasantly surprised by the handful of things i've gotten recently as resale items by them. When did they rebrand?
malefashionadvice,It's funny we get so many slim fit reactionaries when most people here are wearing pretty neutral straight/regular fits
malefashionadvice,"No offense, but those are the worst things for your skin. It's wild to me that major clothing brands convinced the masses that putting plastics and industrial wastes that don't breathe and trap sweat right onto your skin are the way to go for sports wear. They're just cheap. Cotton, linen, even wool all breathe better and wick sweat better than any synthetic. But they're more expensive. And wear out more easily."
malefashionadvice,"Thankfully for my eastern European background, im fortunately far from obese and will stick with slim fits"
malefashionadvice,George Costanza is easily the hottest of the cast. His fits are beyond dope. What are you smoking?
malefashionadvice,"They dont but you can keep persuading yourself that to justify your closet. They accentuate your shortness. Theres no two ways about it. 

George Constanza would’ve looked 100x better on Seinfeld in more slim clothing. The style of the 90s made him look way fatter and even shorter than necessary"
malefashionadvice,"""I don't know how to enjoy my clothes""  


That's okay. If you can't grasp the feeling of drape, drama, and character of a garment do you really love clothes?"
malefashionadvice,Wide fit pants look perfectly dope on shorter dudes (I'm 5 foot 7).
malefashionadvice,"Yeah I don't think so either, just wanted to give my thoughts on the topic of wide vs slim while on the topic. I do think he's right in that too slim is too much, and that the nice middle ground is very pleasant."
malefashionadvice,I thought it was great!
malefashionadvice,lmao
malefashionadvice,"They definitely are, but why did they increase in popularity on Instagram over the past 3 months?"
malefashionadvice,military reproduction websites like what price glory

malefashionadvice,Because they are a good looking and versatile shoe
malefashionadvice,"You absolutely wash it after you've bought it. There was a trend for a while where dudes wouldn't wash their raw denim, believing that it created ""better fades"" but that has mostly fallen out of favor by now.

If your pants are dirty, smelly, or otherwise soiled you should wash them."
malefashionadvice,"I like the wide pants look. The drape around the thighs is nice and comfy, but my ass is hugged *just* right. I used to do it your way, but since I've embraced *wide fits* I can dispense with all the tailoring lol. 

The irony is that what is usually sold as wide fit pants looks more like regular fit on other people with proportions like ours."
malefashionadvice,"Drape isn't the only way for clothes to have character.  And I'm ok with my clothes not having ""drama"", whatever the hell that means.  This is just pretentious crap."
malefashionadvice,"Hey ya'll, a few weeks ago I posted asking for advice going on my first ever first date, and I got a lot of helpful advice. My sad update last week was that I fell really hard for the girl, but she wanted to end things because she got a job interview in a different state that I ironically helped her apply for. Got a lot of sound moving on advice there too. 

Figured I'd close out my cringe arc with one final update, and ask for advice one last time from the fine folks of r/malefashionadvice 

So we were supposed to talk after her interview, but apparently she got sick and ghosted me. She texted me later that she got ignored by the company - they didn't call her for her scheduled interview, and that she still wanted to talk. I said sure, offered some times, and she never got back to me... So I guess I've been ghosted now, twice. 

And that's the end of it really. I spent the past week consuming my body weight in alcohol and cheese curds, trying to spend as much time as I could with my friends. But every time I see something I know was a mutual interest of ours, I immediately get the urge to text her about it, thinking we should do it together, *only to remember there is no we*. Every time I match with a different girl on a dating app, the conversation feels so... *bland and lifeless in comparison*. 

I guess my questions are: how do you not fall so hard for someone you click with, and how do I stop comparing all my future dates to her? 

Maybe this sounds ridiculous, given we were barely a thing anyway. From my pov as the classic ""lonely, socially-stunted younger dude trying to better himself with clothes that fit kinda well"", everything felt more vibrant when we were together, and now it all feels so black and white. 

/sadboi-cringe-rant"

malefashionadvice,"I made the mistake of sharing a Mitchell Moss post about drape because it had such a great picture of Gregory Peck in a well cut suit. 

I should have just let it go when the automod originally deleted it because it immediately devolved into a raging debate about slim vs wide fits and not in the context of tailored clothing which was the whole point of the post. 

Oh well, I hope it made for good reading for the people who may have found it interesting."

malefashionadvice,I think “strong sense of personal style” might be a better term
malefashionadvice,"You have to admit, looser clothes are inherently more inclusive because while a slim person can feel free to move in both loose and slim cut clothes, a wider person will only feel free in one of those."
malefashionadvice,Abercrombie &amp; Fitch. never would have shopped there in the past but they’ve rebranded really well and have good quality stuff. worth a try.
malefashionadvice,"I immediately thought of this quote lol. 

I have 2 Brooks Bros suits that I bought in the middle of the pandemic when I started building out a tailored clothing wardrobe and while I like the way both of them look, neither fit me the way I'd like. One has pants that are too slim and the other fits fine but has weird issues with the shoulders (in a way that no other BB jackets in that size have).

They're not unwearable but I definitely would have benefitted from spending my money elsewhere. It was helpful to have this experience though because I learned something from the experience."
malefashionadvice,"Ooh let me try:

&gt; That said there’s something about ~~slim tailored~~ wide fit clothing that has bothered me for several years: there’s no ~~ability for the cloth to drape~~ expression of the form underneath. No form ~~drape~~ means no ~~drama~~ life, no ~~expression~~ humanity, no ~~character~~ authenticity."
malefashionadvice,Why are the Adidas Sambas very popular recently?
malefashionadvice,Where in the past were clothes ever that slim?
malefashionadvice,"If you’re fit and in shape, a slim fit looks great. If you’re not, go looser. This isn’t hard."
malefashionadvice,I mean no offense but when over 40 percent of this country is obese slim and skinny fits are bound to go out of the window in the name of comfort….
malefashionadvice,That’s the sales engineer’s uniform.
malefashionadvice,Any jean recommendations?
malefashionadvice,"Lots of great unstructured suits from Spier and McKay. SuitSupply has them as well. Even if it’s a conventional cut, something that unstructured, green/tan/brown/orange, and made from cotton/linen or a textured wool, will be a great match for the vibe."
malefashionadvice,Their Italian chino shorts are solid still.
malefashionadvice,I got really lucky and found a used pair on Mercari from 2007 for 30 dollars; best pair of shoes I've gotten in a while
malefashionadvice,They may not sell the one with a hood anymore
malefashionadvice,"I hear what he’s saying, but the zeitgeist is going to read this and bring the “court date suit” into fashion."
malefashionadvice,"And 20 years ago that wouldn't have made more money? In a lot of ways trends are driven by designers. See [this overdone (in)famous clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ja2fgquYTCg) of The Devil Wears Prada that describes how trends get driven. Given designer fashion doesn't make its money by cycling trends, and is driven by the artistic visions of the designers, which are mostly not concerned with cycling trends to maximize profits, as thats only how fast fashion makes money. 

The other driver of trends is organic subcultures and interests, and a lot of money is spent on researching street style across the globe to predict trends in fashion. Wide fit has been bubbling up to become more and more mainstream from like 2018 on, probably really starting in 2016. Companies are not the sole drivers of trends."
malefashionadvice,Lol the extreme fit of the 2010s wasn't even *close* to unprecedented.
malefashionadvice,"Thanks! So you don't wash it after you've bought it either?

I've learned a lot about jeans here. I've always been told not to wash them too often because it will cause wear and tear, but people here say it's important to wash them to prevent oils from degrading the threading. I definitely noticed my favourite pair beginning to get loose around the groin, but I also got weary about washing because the rich colour is definitely starting to fade. Think I'd rather they fade but stay intact though. I'll look out for some raw denim too."
malefashionadvice,Which version of the Moto zip do you have? I only see the one without the hood
malefashionadvice,From a marketing perspective I think we’ll see faster and faster cycling of fashion trends the more often they change the more money to be made
malefashionadvice,Gucci
malefashionadvice,Find me a slim fit suit from the 80s that's as slim as something you could get today? It takes time for all a materials uses to be realised.
malefashionadvice,"Yeah, elastane was NEVER used in previous decades, certainly not the 80s."
malefashionadvice,Same. Everyone knows you’re fucking cheating Uncle Craig it’s just not worth it to confront you. Fuck.
malefashionadvice,"Have you considered a bomber jacket?

Have the AG moto zip...think it's nicer looking than most of the things you listed. Love it, but I'd never consider it a ""mature"" option to wear to work. It's what I wear around the house"
malefashionadvice,Not familiar with this. Is Archer the brand? https://weararcher.com
malefashionadvice,No. Last week. This one: https://bonobos.com/products/the-italian-wool-bomber
malefashionadvice,"Engineered Garments is definitely one I love, and has done stuff that would work in the past though it doesn't look like they're currently producing anything that's quite right. I think most of Evan Kinori and Mister Freedom's stuff is a little \*too\* casual and won't read as quite ""suit"" enough, at least on quick perusal of what's currently available."
malefashionadvice,"Yes, I feel your pain

My big thing is when I find something I do like, I'll go buy the same thing but in a different color or pattern. What I'll get is so much worse and a different league. That frustrates me the most."
malefashionadvice,"I've been climbing for 6 years and injured for 4, take those rest days"
malefashionadvice,"Hello I am looking to get some decent casual tees to go out or wear under an unzipped jacket. I am 

I used to buy getters but I don't like them. 

Budget 20 to 40 per item. I am 6'3"" so preferably they come in long or tall. I wear L for shirts.

Thank you."
malefashionadvice,Yeah slim and relaxed styles come and go but the extreme slim fit of the 2010's was unprecedented and only possible because of materials like elastane. Slimmer cuts may be cutting edge fashion again but I hope we never see the skin tight sausage casing trend ever again.
malefashionadvice,"I would go with regular colored denim if the boots were brown, and probably a different belt."
malefashionadvice,Walmart brand now.  Saw them today
femalefashionadvice,"30th is auto-permission to go wild. Btw, 40 was far more stressful emotionally. Then I grew up and said “well, the alternative is worse”. Now really enjoy buying myself a bday present. Have one in 2 weeks."
femalefashionadvice,"True ya, need more room for da butt"
femalefashionadvice,Also randomly thinking: I wish it was the beginning of winter. In the heat I just look bloated and puffy with pink skin and sweat.
femalefashionadvice,"I can’t make no-show socks stay put (like the itty bitty ones that a person could wear with ballet flats), so I either just go no-sock or embrace showing socks."
femalefashionadvice,"Because I AM on the old side and it has kind of fancy Dynasty (the 80’s version) vibes while being updated with a mandarin collar. I’m very fair with naturally very puffy hair, so I could look very 80’s if it’s a humid day. I’m past the age of 80’s looking cool on me, it looks like I’m still wearing things from the first time around. I DO love the blouse though!

I usually wear things more like… skinny colored pants/jeans with a white Tshirt and black “peacoat” style blazer, nice platform combat boots or loafers. And a long artful scarf just hanging…which seems a little more hip for this 56 yr. old. What do you think?

Don’t get me wrong, I love that I’ve made it this far and think I look pretty good. I’ll be interviewing a lot soon and age does matter."
femalefashionadvice,Straw hat with [streamers in the back](https://www.themusicallyrics.com/h/282-hello-dolly-musical-lyrics/2358-ribbons-down-my-back-lyrics.html)? Profile?
femalefashionadvice,"Alright so in general I like your style a lot and I’m a big fan of many of these looks, but somehow the absolute best part is that gummy bear clip 😅"
femalefashionadvice,Pants without pockets are a no-go for me personally.
femalefashionadvice,I won’t purchase pants with only a zipper (no button) because I cannot trust them. Lol! But seriously.
femalefashionadvice,"I've been hit aggressively by OTT spring vibes this year. It's not even warm yet, but I saw one flower and now I'm in a Regency period drama in my mind. Every time I look at my spring mood board on Pinterest I feel like I've taken drugs. Today I walked to get coffee in [a floral spring dress](https://imgur.com/a/P80LzNs) (with a turtleneck underneath because it's literally still winter) and it had such an effect on me that I immediately ordered a straw hat."
femalefashionadvice,"I have a short torso and a wide ribcage and rock current trends. Mid-rise straight leg, flares, and baggy look great!"
femalefashionadvice,Hey! Fellow short-torsoed bitch here. I have had luck with the Levi's Low Pros - they're a mid-low rise straight leg jean and are solidly mid-rise on me.
femalefashionadvice,"I have a long torso, so they extra don't make sense for me."
femalefashionadvice,Oh please. You're gonna pull a muscle with that reach.
femalefashionadvice,"Has to do with the depth of the seat &amp; the cut for the leg opening, ime."
femalefashionadvice,I would try L.L. Bean and Lands End. Size down for a less boxy fit.
femalefashionadvice,"Correct, I am tall and have a long torso and do not wear jumpsuits or rompers."
femalefashionadvice,My recommendation is always ThredUp! You can get really nice stuff for pretty cheap. It’ll help you experiment and try new styles without spending too much on things you’re not sure about.
femalefashionadvice,Totally agree! I don’t feel comfortable at all without some kind of bra on (even though my chest isn’t that big). It’s so annoying that so many cute tops and dresses are hard to wear because of this! I wish more of them came with a built-in bra or padding to make up for it.
femalefashionadvice,"Thank you!! The cape detached too ☺️
The Claudia cost by CollectIf out of the UK."
femalefashionadvice,The only thongs I can comfortably wear are seamless athletic thongs (I only wear thongs to work out). I have a bunch of under armour ones that I really like
femalefashionadvice,Sounds like shapewear with a front compression panel is what you’re looking for. Maybe the “Body Define Firm Control” from Marks and Spencer?
femalefashionadvice,"(34F)

As everyone who ever sees me comment probably already knows I'm obsessed with Hill House Home dresses. They're mostly bra friendly, and in particular their smocked dresses are great for solving the ""need chest room without being too loose in the waist"" problem. 

I also like Hill House's swim line, but the most supportive swim top I bought last year was from Abercrombie's Curve Love line. 

My only secret to wearing off the shoulder things is to wear a corset instead of a bra which I realize is not an ideal solution for some. Unfortunately I can't do tape so backless is out for me thus far."
femalefashionadvice,I like Madewell and Big Bud Press!
femalefashionadvice,I’ve been thinking about getting some carharts overalls! Any other brand you would suggest? Thanks for your comment. ❣️
femalefashionadvice,Try opera gloves/long gloves and just a red scarf
femalefashionadvice,What do people have with color ? Why’s everything beige. Color is fun. Color can be beautiful smh.
femalefashionadvice,"Was hoping someone could provide some advice on similar (but less expensive) bags to this one: https://www.sezane.com/en/product/milo-bag/orange-multicoloured-jacquard#size-TU . Love love love the print on it and the warmth like redness of it. 
Also some qs: has anyone had any bags like this where it has material sewed into leather? Have you ever had it becoming discoloured or had a stain on it? 
Also has anyone bought from sezane before and is it worth it? Are there any issues with this style of bag that I haven’t thought of? Keen to hear thoughts!"
femalefashionadvice,"Assuming people who enjoy wearing something perceived as dressy are attention-seeking is such weird middle school energy. 

On a related note, I also have to feel comfortable in order to do anything, which may include dressing a certain way, changing my hair, washing my face, taking a shower, etc. To be clear, this isn't an ""I'm too insecure not to look my best"" situation, I usually look weird, it's more of an ""I need to feel clean and wear an outfit that supports my mood and I literally won't be able to enjoy the activity unless I take care of those needs"" thing. And it stresses me out when people who are mad at me for being incapable of spontaneity are like ""ugh, just go the way you are now, nobody will even care"" along with various comments that imply that I'm fussy and high maintenance out of some extreme vanity."
femalefashionadvice,"absolutely none! free the ladies! 

but in all seriousness I love going out tops with no bra. ngl I kinda think the no-bra movement has led trends here"

femalefashionadvice,"Shapewear that wont make me look rounder


Hello everyone - let me preface this with I am in the UK so all sizes etc will be uk sizes.

Ok I am 5,4"" and a uk 14. I am looking for some shapewear to smooth me out and to pull my lower tummy in. The issue with shapewear I have tried before is that it all seems to smoosh everything to my front so I look bigger/rounder/ pregnant. I have tries the dress style, shorts and vest. Any idea of if any shapewear will work for me? Also preferably brands I can return too, I really don't fancy paying another £50 for it to look awful."
femalefashionadvice,I LOLed at your comment. I keep buying them (mules) because there’s so many adorable ones and I love the concept of easy on/easy off. I’m sure I’ll crack the code or find my brand someday. It won’t be for lack of trying ;-)
femalefashionadvice,The skirt is from [RENEJ](https://us.wconcept.com/plp/brand/index?brands=renej)!
femalefashionadvice,"I just got flares too and love them. They are longer than my skinny jeans (which stopped at my ankle). So they make my legs look longer. Since the style is different, it makes all my outfits look more ""intentional"" too."
femalefashionadvice,I'm a 9.5 and this kills me every time bc 8.5 is *always* the last half size :(

femalefashionadvice,"Today is my 30th and I fear I’m having a 3/8ths-life-crisis. I have wanted to splurge on an outfit that feels confident and fancier than I usually do, and I kept getting more anxious as the date neared. Has anyone else felt the same kind of mounting pressure as an important date neared (a date, an interview, a milestone)?

Probably best I didn’t pull the trigger on any (of many) carts, but I decided it’s time I prioritize my wardrobe since it can have a big effect on my confidence. Im committed to doing it slowly, though, so I don’t blow money on clothes I won’t want to keep."

femalefashionadvice,I love the ribcage! I just wish full-length ones were easier to find in Canada
femalefashionadvice,It doesn’t look the rise fits you quite right. I’d take them back. Plenty of jeans out there!
femalefashionadvice,Are you sure the shoulders fit? If they aren’t in the right spot it will throw the bust off.
femalefashionadvice,"Literally why is everything “trendy” low back, hyper cropped, cut out shapes, swooping low v neck, and SHEER…what bra am I supposed to wear with any of those…that’s it."
femalefashionadvice,I guess a lot of shoppers want to either emphasize or camouflage right now? Not sure myself…
femalefashionadvice,"The most powerful thing that makes you able to ""pull off"" a certain look is *how you feel in that look*. Most people take that to mean confidence, which is true, but even more powerful than that is *authenticity.* 

If you get dressed and feel more true to who you are than ever; If you look in the mirror and without missing a beat, think to yourself, ""Now THIS is ME!"", then you've found your secret weapon in the battle against body image issues. 

I first discovered this last Halloween when I used the holiday as an excuse to dress in a bold, alternative look (black ripped shorts, fishnets, combat boots, belt with draping chains, sheer black stretch top to show my black bra underneath, black moto jacket, dark lip &amp; eye makeup). Despite showing more skin than ever before, it felt so authentic to me that THAT made me feel confident!

As a woman of size and someone who's had an ED for the last 23 years, confidence in how I look is NOT very accessible to me. But this authentic fashion realization has helped me more than anything else when I get dressed every day. 

Hopefully it can help others, too."
femalefashionadvice,"It was custom made for the movie out vintage fabric. The wardrobe dept wanted to make it look like something the character would just throw together herself. You could probably replicate it yourself, or buy  a similar dress and hem it that length or ask a seamstress to make you one."

femalefashionadvice,What's with shoe makers cutting out half sizes once they get to larger sizes? People with big feet still want an accurate fit.

A casual blouse and tailored shorts possibly."

femalefashionadvice,"I'd call Big Baby vibe ""French schoolgirl in joggers"". I like it because it has humor and the back collar and bow are \*kiss\*."
femalefashionadvice,About 5 years and counting. I became interested in discovering my personal basics in my early 30’s and have slowly realized my go to favorites over time.
femalefashionadvice,"That makes sense. I'm relatively short, so I guess I'll have to keep an eye out for a not-too-high high rise"
femalefashionadvice,"Two things:

1.) So frustrated about people saying self-righteously (as a way to justify not making an effort to dress up) ""ugh, no one's going to be looking at us anyway"" as if wearing something semi nice is narcissistic (?)

2.) OTOH, super tickled that my most upvoted Reddit comment of all time is me lamenting I can't walk in mules. Who knew there were so many of us out there?"
femalefashionadvice,It's very cute. Can you just tug it down so the front is flat? That should fix the bust part.
femalefashionadvice,Is [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/11cp9nb/your_wardrobe_is_outdated_what_now_step_1_skinny/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button) the one you mean?
femalefashionadvice,Hi all! I work in a kitchen. I literally have my hair up and am in black leggings and a big tee 100% of the time. Any suggestion on cute kitchen wear? My boss is super lax. I don’t have to have Chef pants and can wear any type of style cloths I want as long as I have close toed shoes. Any suggestions would be awesome!
femalefashionadvice,I hope you do find one! It’s so soft and flashy - it gets *the most* compliments when I travel
femalefashionadvice,"Cool, I will! Thank you!"
femalefashionadvice,"[Club Monaco lambskin leather moto jacket](https://imgur.com/a/lhHURcd) (feel free to ask for more pictures including measurements) - Size large, fits more like a medium imo. One of the tags still attached, only ever tried on. Original price was $595 I believe. Looking for $200 but open to offers :)

Shipping from Illinois, willing to ship anywhere in the US."
femalefashionadvice,"I have never been a navy person but have been realizing that black doesn’t really go very well with a lot of other colors because the contrast is so stark. After seeing a lot of fashion people I really enjoy say that navy is their neutral not black, I thought why not try it. It does seem more versatile and I like it but black still has my heart."
femalefashionadvice,Thank you! I am IN LOVE and want to find this!
femalefashionadvice,Try getting jeans that have some sanded in them. They tend to be more fitted and stay snug. I was in H&amp;M recently and the sales girl said all their jeans are baggy. Not my thing
femalefashionadvice,Try looking in thrift shops. You just might find what you’re looking for.
femalefashionadvice,"I just got 2 pr of flair jeans after reading the long post (I think it was here) about skinny jeans and making ladies like me (mid 60s) look old. I meant to save it and didn’t. If anyone has a link, I’d appreciate it. She did mention ways to make them look more on tend as I’ll still wear mine. I don’t go much with trends but I do like flare/bell bottom jeans. Thank you"
femalefashionadvice,I asked them to ship my items back and i received my package today. I opened my jewelery’s box and it was empty. The package was sealed and it was not defected. So they either forgot to put it inside the box or one of their staff stole it. I contacted them and i was told there will be an investigation. Does anyone know what’s waiting for me?
femalefashionadvice,Brown leather cross-body satchel. Goes with anything and is versatile and convenient.
femalefashionadvice,"Thanks for the feedback. I think I just have annoying body proportions...I do have a fairly short torso, so midrise would be a good thing to look for. 

My hip:waist:thigh ratio is a bit of a challenge, when I went a size up in these pants they were way too baggy and the waistband was gapping a lot. The ones I'm wearing fit my waist perfectly, but we're tighter on my hips and thighs."
femalefashionadvice,"Also possible! 

I should have clarified and said the first time you get to wear high-end brands *that suit you* because “your mileage may vary” really does apply to everything"
femalefashionadvice,"Hey friends! I'm looking for help with my Halloween costume, Elektra Natchios from Marvel Comics :)

[Here's the image inspo I'm going for.](https://imgur.com/a/gtghGtp)

[In my original thread y'all helped me find a skirt/tunic topic, ended up getting them separately but it should work!](https://old.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/10va5tt/daily_questions_thread_february_06_2023/j7i6pqp/?context=3)

Now I'm hoping for help with the red headband, the black gloves. Mostly with names so I can search around. Is the headband essentially just like a red silk scarf tied in a certain way? And what would black gloves that go that high up the arm be called?

Thank you &lt;3"
femalefashionadvice,I think it’s more their quality that surprised me! Maybe I just don’t like lambskin or whatever it was.
femalefashionadvice,Also not surprising. All bodies are different!
femalefashionadvice,"Damn, had the opposite experience with Chanel ballet flats I bought in 2011"
femalefashionadvice,I've tried heel grips with no luck. Haven't heard of toe pouches though so I'll look those up! Thanks. :)
femalefashionadvice,"If you want completely sheer, you probably will need to go for a thicker more sweater like material. Anything like the everlane one will probably be sheer."
femalefashionadvice,I didn’t even think to switch from back to navy! I’m struggling not to by black and I don’t want to. I have enough.
femalefashionadvice,"“Your 30s are weird.” Is the truest thing I’ve read all day. Like, how do I dress like a millennial who isn’t afraid of looking like a millennial but who also pays attention to culture and is willing to change with the times? I don’t want to dress young but I do want to dress current and has that led me to driving loafers?"
femalefashionadvice,"i meant smth you would never buy, a piece of clothing that you wouldn’t buy for any reason"
femalefashionadvice,alr tyty
femalefashionadvice,"FedEx can definitely be a wild trip, they are definitely my least favorite carrier."
femalefashionadvice,Can you link to an example of what you mean by fitted tops that are long enough? It could give others an idea of how to help you as that description is pretty vague.
femalefashionadvice,"Yes it's super cute! If you like it, definitely get it tailored."
femalefashionadvice,"https://preview.redd.it/0bu48bflm8la1.jpeg?width=1800&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=1659e886afdfbde64a405eddd8fa11ad61f40320

Just a fun “style evolution” photo. I thought people here would get a kick out of it! Cleveland Museum of Art 2002 on the left 2022 or the right.

I wore my flats for walking around outside but had a pair of black pumps for wearing indoors. Really had a lot of fun reshooting the handful of photos twenty years later!

If you like art history, the Rodin “The Thinker” behind me is messed up on the bottom because terrorist tried to blow it up in the 1970s. CMA is an A+ museum, a must see if you visit."
femalefashionadvice,"Dude same!! Fashion feels so weird recently! I lost some weight in the last year and have had to basically replace my entire wardrobe and I swear, I cannot find any jeans or pants that fit me properly. Everything seems so frumpy and off, which doesn’t make me feel good about my new body. It’s nice to hear that other people also sometimes feel like a potato"
femalefashionadvice,"Random local shop a few years ago but i'd keep looking, especially second hand and sales now/over the warm months. I got mine on sale for dirt cheap around this time."
femalefashionadvice,"Hi, friend. I read elsethread that you meant ""purchase"". Maybe if you elaborate on your post and talk more about what you mean in this post, you'll get more comments and upvotes?"
femalefashionadvice,"It's ridiculously hard to find anything with princess seams or darts to add some shape that's *also* wearable to work (not cropped, no big cut-outs, can wear a normal bra with it, etc.)"
femalefashionadvice,"This has been a lifesaver for me, both around restroom use and needing different sizes for top and bottom!"
femalefashionadvice,Does anyone remember that post from awhile ago about high fashion matching bright green with a rich cobalt blue? Was it an inspo album or just lots of runway looks? And can anyone find it again cause I cannot and I want it!
femalefashionadvice,Have you tried heel grips or toe pouches?
femalefashionadvice,"Well, I just think that if you find clothes that fit you in the first place then shapewear is not necessary. Unless the point is that you have such a negative image of your own body that you have to wear that crap to ""slim down"" like having a tummy isn't natural or something."
femalefashionadvice,"Yeah. I just never wear white (even my wedding dress was silver) because it doesn’t suit me. No crisp white shirt, no white broderie Edwardian/hippie goddess dress, no plain white t for me 🤷🏻‍♀️"
femalefashionadvice,i kinda like that slip on dress
femalefashionadvice,i feel like ik why and i get it tbh
femalefashionadvice,purchase
femalefashionadvice,my post has no upvotes and like only ten commengs
femalefashionadvice,"i didnt mean to be negative at all, it was supposed to be lighthearted"
femalefashionadvice,Fashion tape also!
femalefashionadvice,I'm sooo missing slightly fitted/fitted tops that are long enough to tuck into my pants and stay there.
femalefashionadvice,Depending on where you live flannel can be a great summer layer over tanks or camis for cool nights and air conditioned places.
femalefashionadvice,"Unfortunately it's (almost) the only content that gets attention. If you look through the top posts of all time, so many of them are negative posts, complaint posts, or posts hating on fashion trends. Nothing unites this sub like hating fashion. 💀"
femalefashionadvice,Very excited for sheer this spring
femalefashionadvice,I ordered a bunch of items from Rihoas before seeing this thread.......wishing I had done more research!! I received my package (after 20 days) and some stuff is better quality than others. I am keeping one shirt but the other 5 items either didn't fit or were bad quality. I requested a return.... I will let you all know how that goes.
femalefashionadvice,"Actually J. Jill looks promising (and petite sizes is a big plus). This is really for casual wear and I like them for traveling in the summer when I don't want sticky legs in shorts so they don't need to be trendy. 

Also forgot about Not Perfect Linen so thanks!"
femalefashionadvice,"These are more trouser than what I'm looking for. I work from home and where I live is pretty casual so I just wouldn't have an opportunity to wear them, but thank you!"
femalefashionadvice,"Since the dress is glittery I think you could keep jewelry fairly simple, similar to how the models are styled. So maybe a drop or hoop earring in a complimentary color and no necklace, or a necklace with simple earrings.

I've been seeing a lot of flat slingbacks, and ballerina flats maybe something like this? [https://www.stories.com/en\_usd/shoes/flats/balletflats/product.slingback-leather-ballet-flats-white.1124024001.html](https://www.stories.com/en_usd/shoes/flats/balletflats/product.slingback-leather-ballet-flats-white.1124024001.html)  
Doesn't seem like the shoes will be very visible, so as long as they're presentable it should be fine."
femalefashionadvice,"Lol Chanel isn’t personally my thing but yeah, I get it, my out-of-reach love is McQueen"
femalefashionadvice,"And that it’s *chanel* that’s like the worst one to be right, it’s so expensive vintage lmao 

The other pair is miu miu and I can cope with that tag better but ugh woe is me"
femalefashionadvice,Thanks for the tip!
femalefashionadvice,"I love couples that have a vision but this theme will probably be so confusing for guests lol and I imagine you will see a wide variety. Black tie optional to me would mean long dress but the last wedding I went to that had that as the dress code there were people in jeans so who knows. 

I think I would pick a color from one of the inspiration pictures and find a dress in the palette. So the 5th picture for instance, a dress in a similar color: [https://www.lulus.com/products/love-and-beyond-marigold-burnout-floral-maxi-dress/1536536.html](https://www.lulus.com/products/love-and-beyond-marigold-burnout-floral-maxi-dress/1536536.html)  
With multicolored bangles, I feel like this is a good opportunity to wear funky jewelry to a wedding."
femalefashionadvice,Why would that age you?
femalefashionadvice,"Yeah, the first time you get to wear high-end brands it’s like “goddammit, everyone was right”"
femalefashionadvice,"I guess I might not exactly be the type of person who your question is targeted at because I've never considered myself to have any particular kind of ""aesthetic"" or ""style"" - but I've been trying recently!

This past fall, I decided I wanted to have a more consistent wardrobe because it'll take less time/effort for me to choose outfits each day and there'll be better chance I'll feel confident/look good in them. My previous cold-weather clothing was mostly stuff I had gotten \~10 years ago, so I've been really happy with the update. II started looking at this sub + a couple of instagram and youtube channels to figure out what I liked, and made a pinterest to be able to put all the stuff I liked in one place where I could see it. Once I kind of figured out what kind of aesthetic I wanted to go for, I bought several solid, brightly-colored sweaters and a few pairs of pants in a couple of solid colors and a couple of patterns and in cuts that I hadn't tried before (wide leg, split hem, etc.). 

Now, random people started complimenting my outfits when I'm out, which has never happened to me before! And it does take much less time to pick an outfit and get ready, and I do feel more confident and feel like my personality is reflected a bit through my clothes. I don't know if I'll get bored of it in a few years or so, but it's really working for me right now."
femalefashionadvice,"Bought in a shop, in Belfast, some time before 2015!  They have Italia 1967 on the tongue.  Nothing shows up in Google images.  Sorry, I can't post a photo, I don't have a smartphone."
femalefashionadvice,"It's not you, it's the blouses. More and more of them seem to billow out these days. At first back in 2016-2020, they were just boxy, now they are distinctly [trapezoidal](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0950/9820/products/DOEN-2021-FALL-2_JANE-BLOUSE_SALT-01.jpg?v=1674569650&amp;width=713)

It drives me insane. Been shopping for blouses lately, 8/10 trapezoid."
femalefashionadvice,"Okay out of curiosity has anyone else had Fedex shipping with Vestiaire go on a wild freaking adventure??

I live in NJ. My package started in Brooklyn NY. “Super! It’ll be here soon!” I thought. But oh, ooooh I was wrong. 

Next thing I know it’s in HAWAII, then Northern California, and now New Mexico??? Why is my package on a nice lil vacation road trip? I could’ve driven to get this thing omg. It’s not stuck anywhere but it clearly is in a weird place and taking an even weirder way back but *why*

Has anyone else had this happen??! I don’t use fedex often, I’ve never used Vestiaire before? Is this normal???!"
femalefashionadvice,"Dirt comes out of them super easy - I haven't had any issues with staining. They're sort of a soft nylon material with some stretch that stuff sort of slips off of? Not sure how to explain it. I haven't been getting knee-deep in dirt in them super regularly, but so far so good! It sounds like I'm a Duluth rep but I just really like these lol"
femalefashionadvice,"Here’s a link to a sold Poshmark listing - it’s old enough now that retail pages for it aren’t coming up in Google searches (not my Poshmark account, I didn’t sell it and I didn’t buy it there either) 😮‍💨

femalefashionadvice,"Hello there! I'm a 28 year old female (29 in 7 months). My style has gone through a large evolution over the year: I was hyper-fem through early middle school (only wore skirts, dresses, or a pink sweat suit, never jeans or pants), then I evolved into dipping my toes into the alt scene in high school (very much baby, small town Alternative though-no colored hair or piercings, but definitely layered hair, lots of black Eyeliner, Converse, graphic tees, and skinny jeans), then in college I was very much the poster girl for 2012-2016 fashion, and now I'm kind of just a mix of everything I guess? 

My job doesn't have a dress code, dress code. Attire can range from nice casual to business professional, depending on the department. For my department, I'd say that range is more nice casual to business casual and this varies from day to day/if we have a special meeting or event. I've been slowly building my work wardrobe as I got my job after only working as a student and then we entered the pandemic so I didn't really buy ""professional"" or work-specific clothes for 2 years. Other than that, my purchases are leaning towards wardrobe staples with like 1-2 ""fun"" items per season as I've built up quite the closet over the years. 

I used to wear makeup everyday but my job got really hectic in Fall 2022 and I also was in a really bad mental state, so I just stopped doing it. Makeup does bring me immense joy and I love experimenting with different colors, especially with my eyeshadow. I also have quite the collection of makeup, so I'm on a low-buy right now. I'm trying to more focus on skincare as I'm approaching my 30s.  On the other side of that coin, I'm helpless when it comes to my hair. I recently bought some hot rollers to try those out since I have trouble working a curling iron (I always somehow manage to crimp the ends of my hair and the curls never stay anyway), but I haven't been brave enough to try them yet. I usually wash my hair, air dry it, and let it do its own thing aside from brushing it. 

Some final fun facts: I have very short nail beds which I jokingly call my ""child nails"" (my thumb nails are also very wide so press-ons don't really fit them); I have a pretty severe fragrance allergy (just short of anaphylaxis) so I have to be extremely careful of the products I use (Vanilla, cinnamon, and most fruit scents are usually ""safe"" while floral are an instant no-go); my mom always says I should've went into fashion design because I loved to design clothes growing up (I still love to sketch gowns here and there when the mood strikes). 

I stumbled upon this thread when looking for recommendations for the comfiest high heel brands (my go-to is usually Naturalizer) and saw it had some great advice on it. Excited to be part of the conversation!"
femalefashionadvice,"Is this top cute? Love everything about it, but I don’t fill out the boob area. Should I get it tailored to remove some extra fabric?

A mid-calf stretchy pencil skirt in a dark colour. Such a reliable basic.

Flattering comfy dark wash jeans.

The perfect white or cream shirt. An ongoing quest..."
femalefashionadvice,"&gt;Kappa faux leather shoe

Do you have the site of this specific shoe?"
femalefashionadvice,The Kermit hat 🙌
femalefashionadvice,I was thinking it might be nice with the pinks specifically for that reason a bit of a watermelon/strawberry kiwi palette makes me smile but I have yet to try it myself.
femalefashionadvice,"This kind of content used to be strongly discouraged, if not outright disallowed under a previous mod team."
femalefashionadvice,Thanks for trying!
femalefashionadvice,I never really find myself wanting athletic shoes but I am so enamored with these ones it might be worth it to work out some new outfits.
femalefashionadvice,"Not gonna say never, because I have said that MANY times in the past and proven myself wrong."
femalefashionadvice,"Thanks so much!

The yellow is more of an autumn and winter color for me and the teal duster is the only thing I own in that shade.  I think it will hit storage until next winter fairly soon.  My hope is that I can replace some of that yellow with green for summer."
femalefashionadvice,"hi, thank you for replying! tailor the waistband as in make it bigger or smaller? Usually jeans are very loose on the waist and tight on the hips for me so I was actually happy when I tried these on and felt they fit me well lol"
femalefashionadvice,Yeah I know nipple covers work for show through but it still feels weird having no bra on in a lot of environments. I feel naked even though nothing is visible! Haha
femalefashionadvice,"Eileen Fisher System (what used to be their core capsule) high waist ankle cropped wide leg pant in stretch crepe.  They had a zip fly and button and were perfect. Here's a link: [https://www.eileenfisher.com/system-lightweight-washable-stretch-crepe-wide-leg-pant/EETL-P4067.html?loc=US](https://www.eileenfisher.com/system-lightweight-washable-stretch-crepe-wide-leg-pant/EETL-P4067.html?loc=US)

They discontinued them for some nasty elastic waist (elastic pull on waists are not bad.  The new design for these pants, however, is literally the worst redesign on a classic, ever.)

I swear to gah fashion &amp; makeup companies are like ""did you find your holy grail? oh really?  BE A SHAME IF WE...DISCONTINUED IT"" then they cackle and throw their heads back."
femalefashionadvice,This FRS Opera Cape. It’s the most beautiful thing I have ever seen
femalefashionadvice,"I think these are cute they just need to get the waistband tailored! I think they’d sit perfectly with the waist the right size, could be worth another $10-20 to get altered if you like them."
femalefashionadvice,"I probably could, but really, I’ve outgrown the need for a reliable LBD, so while I certainly *miss* the reliability of this dress for me, my inability to wear it hasn’t created a blank spot in my wardrobe. I should probably rehome it but an opportunity to do so hasn’t really come up yet."
femalefashionadvice,"Hi fashionable people! Recently I thrifted these Zara jeans and now I'm on the fence about keeping them. Here's [some pictures](https://imgur.com/a/Qr6CplO) (sorry about the poor quality they were literally taken with a webcam lol). 

My problem is with the length (I'm pretty petite so I don't know if that makes me look even shorter) and especially the crotch. It looks kinda bunched, no? I like the jeans but I don't know if they're doing me any favours.

What do y'all think? Do they look cool or awkward? Or do you have any styling tips for them?

Thanks you ♥"
femalefashionadvice,"So this high rise is definitely too much for your torso length I think, but I also think that this fit perhaps is wrong for you in combo with that. The diaper effect seems to be because the thigh and waist look too tight while the middle looks too loose. 

Are these meant to be a straight leg or looser fit? If so you probably just need to size up

Do you have a short torso? Jeans which are technically mid rise may be more accurate of a high rise for you, or you may only need a shorter high rise option, it would depend a bit on measurements"
femalefashionadvice,"That’s a similar thought process I’ve had, tbh."
femalefashionadvice,"You are so right about the shipping cost, I hadn't thought about it that way! And their returns are not free. I'm keeping it :D"
femalefashionadvice,Will the light muted blue charmeuse age me? Probably better to stick with black.
femalefashionadvice,"thanks a lot! even though I don't feel very inspired fashion wise and personal style wise rn, at least I'm pretty proud of my closet and overall style. I'm a big fan of thrifting and vintage, particularly bc older things were made better and hold up. plus, anything that you really love is a staple. 

my bf has a cute dorm tee from his college that he loves. it's super worn, has holes and thinning, but he loves it and has had it for 10yrs. it's a staple for him (tho we'll see for how much longer lololol).

also a great hat goes a long way! I have a kind of classic beige, wool medium-big flat brim hat that I cannot remember how I got. Probably someone's hand me down or a festival find. But it looks great forever, has been everywhere with me, and is actually very useful."
femalefashionadvice,Such a cold weather staple!

Damnit

Finally I am aware that their quality is worth the hunt. I get those of you who are vintage designer hunters now."

femalefashionadvice,"I'd keep without even thinking about it. To me it's the same as when you order just above the free shipping amount, but your returns make the order below the free shipping level. Just as they wouldn't retrospectively ask you to pay the shipping, I don't think they should ask you to return the gift either."
femalefashionadvice,"Silhouettes that are close to the body without clinging to the body are the most flattering, I think. Then your clothes aren’t adding volume. It’s hard to find clothing like that, though. It seems like everything is either oversized or skin tight."
femalefashionadvice,"A lot of core Japanese brands are one size fits all. When I went, I was around a US 6-8 with a 32DD bust. I couldn't fit into one size bottoms at all. Tops I could get away with if it was a stretchier fabric or not darted around the bust.

Uniqlo is great to hit there and is very size inclusive. H&amp;M also leans into Japanese style there with offerings we don't get elsewhere. I liked browsing department stores too, though a lot of brands are kinda boutique so the sizing is all over the shop. 

I will warn you, if you're taller than 5'4, fits may be difficult. To use H&amp;M as an example, the items were automatically petite."
femalefashionadvice,"I’m a lil snot but I say go for it. If they ask for it back then give it, but I doubt they will"
femalefashionadvice,"[this ](https://www.uniqlo.com/us/en/products/E456013-000/00?colorDisplayCode=00&amp;sizeDisplayCode=004&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMI0aXtqbq7_QIVjElyCh2RHQsnEAQYAyABEgKWGPD_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds)
from Uniqlo?"
femalefashionadvice,A Burberry scarf. It was a gift from an ex and has now lasted me twice the length of that relationship. The classic pattern really does match everything.
femalefashionadvice,Boden!
femalefashionadvice,"Aww that’s super sweet! I don’t listen to podcasts much, fashion seems a difficult topic to convey things in the medium, but I suppose fashion history totally would work. 

Do you listen to any/know of any? I’d totally check it out"
femalefashionadvice,"I hear [Koios](https://www.koio.co/products/capri-triple-white?variant=42029028081833) are good quality. Can't personally vouch for their longevity but several stylists I trust recommend them, so I'll get back to you in a few months when mine have more wear and tear :)"
femalefashionadvice,In my case is that's I'm too skinny and most things look baggy or make me look too thin.
femalefashionadvice,"Awww you’re the sweetest!

I had really wanted to go into fashion design, but unfortunately due to an injury have outrageously poor fine motor skills. Had to relearn to write and everything! So sewing and a lot of detail oriented crafting is out of the question for my hands. 

So just kinda threw the interest at stylist work for friends for free instead, and cause most people can’t afford a stylist to help explain stuff but could really use them so they don’t feel bad in clothes, I just do it here for free now that I have the time"
femalefashionadvice,"Beat me to it, that was my first thought!

For me, both categories, ripped/holey/frayed jeans.  I am happy wearing denim jackets which started solid and now are rubbed at the cuffs/collar after years of enjoyment.  But I wouldn't buy them like that even in charity shops."
femalefashionadvice,Yeah totally. Maybe use mod mail to report?
femalefashionadvice,"This sounds very magical- the dress fit you at different sizes and different points in your life because you needed it to. Now, you don’t need it, so even though it should fit you, it doesn’t. It might be time to pass it on to someone else who needs it. 

Side note: I would love to read a book about a dress like this lol!"
femalefashionadvice,"Okay so a little over your budget (I'm sorry!) but I have these [pants](https://www.rails.com/collections/womens-pants-shorts/products/marnie-black?variant=41869133545641) from Rails in both black and white and love love love them, thinking of buying another pair. They're a linen/cotton blend and they're lightweight and breathable enough to wear out dancing for me (I run super hot). I wear them 2-3x a week and have been since July and they've held up super well. I do have to steam them every so often if that's a problem for you but I suspect most linen will be the same, even linen blends.

Worth a look at least!"
femalefashionadvice,I’m not looking forward to spring fashion. I’m loving lug-sole boots and oversized fits on top. Spring to me is always the onset of florals and dresses but I’m still in my flannel phase.
femalefashionadvice,Where'd you get your pink coat?? I am dying for one!
femalefashionadvice,"Cool, love that somebody’s home! Just after someone else asked about FAQ links having a ton being broken I was curious"

Does anyone know where this matching set is from?!"
femalefashionadvice,"is it just me or pretty much all sneakers in shops nowadays look like they were designed by 10 years old? lets not even talk about any of the design having any practical use while walking, and the price tag is no different, the more useless the higher the price. /my thoughts for the day"
femalefashionadvice,Thank you!!
femalefashionadvice,"I keep saying it but I’m loving the red. Definitely wearing the opaque red tight myself after seeing Leandra Medine Cohen do it during the winter. I like that it’s that bright primary cherry color vs a more muted tone. Also, this album is just affirming my need for more metallic shoes and belts, particularly silver. I’m loving the mirror like finish vs just the silver tone with texture that you sometimes see. I feel like the more smooth/foil has definitely been the kind of metallic that’s been around this time."
femalefashionadvice,"Those look too tight in the waist, in the hip, and a bit in the thigh."
femalefashionadvice,Definitely have noticed a shift to the big necklace and big earring but not together. It’s something I’m moving to - only doing one at a time but sculptural and silver. I’ve been thinking silver and telling anyone who’ll listen for the last half a year lol which is mostly my bf who doesn’t want to hear it anymore.
femalefashionadvice,"It feels silly asking this question but here it goes:

I ordered 2 coats from a website to try two different styles, and decided to keep only one. This website adds a free gift with each purchase and an second gift if your order is higher than a certain amount.

I got both gifts (even though I removed them from my cart). I did not care about them but the 2nd gift is actually quite nice and I'd like to keep it. Do you think I should keep it, even if I'm returning the more expensive coat? I wouldn't have received it if I had only bought the coat I'm keeping."
femalefashionadvice,"I have a pair of Kappa faux leather shoes which maybe you could call sneakers - not Converse type not Keds type, not really sporty.  They are almost ten years old, as I bought them before I retired which was 2015.  They are in my regular rotation of five pairs of shoes for this time of years, will certainly go to the end of the season.  Definitely scruffy but not worn out.  Very very comfortable, I don't exercise but do a lot of walking.  Hope this is of use -  I am UK, don't shop online, and rarely new, these were though."
femalefashionadvice,"I love my leather belts from Levi's. They are sturdy, a good price point for leather, and go with everything bc the design is so simple. I think I remember seeing somewhere that Levi's is having a big sale next week."
femalefashionadvice,"Well it happened to me. I was so excited to see someone in the same hot topic dress at my first nightclub (for 18 and over), but that girl just rolled her eyes at me and kept walking 🥲"
femalefashionadvice,"Allbirds are great for many people with plantar fasciitis and bunions, but don’t work for some people with those issues.

Let me just drop a link to [Barking Dog Shoes](https://www.barkingdogshoes.com/amp/), a site that reviews comfort and orthopedic shoes, and includes a handy index by foot issue."
femalefashionadvice,"I know that feeling—“busty rectangle with a shorter than average for my height measurement from shoulder to natural waist” is how I would describe my own shape, and it can be a bit of a challenge to find clothes that fit well!"
femalefashionadvice,"I think a department store such as Nordstrom is best because she can try lots of styles and brands. If you want to buy online, Nip Tuck is a reasonably-priced brand aimed at the more mature customer."
femalefashionadvice,"Im sure a hot potato, tho"
femalefashionadvice,"J. Jill has been doing some nicely made pants in good quality linen the past couple of years. Not super fashion forward, but not as frumpy as some of their styles.

I know a lot of people here swear by the Eastern European linen sellers on Etsy, like Not Perfect Linen. Might be worth a look?"
femalefashionadvice,I think they’re these [Toteme ones](https://www.googleadservices.com/pagead/aclk?sa=L&amp;ai=DChcSEwim6MKjtbv9AhWsFdQBHbN-AnUYABASGgJvYQ&amp;ae=2&amp;ohost=www.google.com&amp;cid=CAESa-D21IPzCjH6hP8Y2vUmHYKebv2QyR9O-CL6NS0_MJ6pKvHIQOxiYEgdfFkJv3RveTMVrM6DCLo2PSzSVS7WsTpBYejei5CbNgPvHhCy5RoJbbtQWbRrk7wlVKTA2nBJ959EQz5g29FZHWNE&amp;sig=AOD64_0JoEhK8DENwKfN60nJiUtr-j1aWQ&amp;ctype=5&amp;q=&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjjxrijtbv9AhXpnWoFHTZuBJAQwg8oAHoECAIQLA&amp;nis=2&amp;dct=1&amp;adurl=) or these [Khaite ones](https://www.googleadservices.com/pagead/aclk?sa=L&amp;ai=DChcSEwjO25HBtbv9AhX5E9QBHXAGBqEYABAJGgJvYQ&amp;ae=2&amp;ohost=www.google.com&amp;cid=CAESa-D2Aj6XRRWS6Kfi_f1gZZ7evvx9gJwenSGbomUWnpPwwNNEhki_j4GR5ucHxljJ_og9juHZdkUM9OutE5aRraC1NW3qshJ6PXtP5Z5mNhjPMnJqsoAszkXt6p6ekffeUtu5dO7Msuev19av&amp;sig=AOD64_1pv1aoewlZyCZHRSI5W2GE5S2qLg&amp;ctype=5&amp;q=&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiB44jBtbv9AhVvk2oFHSWtDOMQwg8oAHoECAIQCg&amp;adurl=) that have been big the past couple of years.

femalefashionadvice,My mom is same age range and is olabsolutrly obsessed with Miracle Suit.
femalefashionadvice,"Also 58 here, and I second Athleta and Albion Fit, and also Lands’ End. Some other places I always look are Garnet Hill and Swimsuits for All. The old-school department stores like Macy’s, Dillard’s, Belk, Nordstrom, etc., are another place to find good quality swimwear in more covered-up styles.

I loved visiting Tahiti so much! I hope your mom and your aunts have a blast."
femalefashionadvice,Is there a tag or anything? I don't recognize that as any of the common activewear brands and a reverse image search didn't bring anything up.
femalefashionadvice,"I like some granola, Im usually drawn to unique textures or silhouettes. I'm still figuring style out but I would say I really like some of the maximalist instas I've seen along with a lot of 50-60s vintage. Unfortunately cheap vintage from those time periods don't often come in sizes that fit so looking to expand my options. Ive got a well paying job for the first time in my life and I can finally afford to be choosey :)"
femalefashionadvice,"Oh man, that's just terrifying, good on you for making it work!"
femalefashionadvice,"RE: taking off a jumpsuit... I have one for semiformal events that has a zipper in the back.  Like, asking for my SO to zip me up kind of zipper.  Luckily I have a super cute chain belt whose clap fits on the zipper so I used it as an impromptu zipper pull.  I was totally expecting to have to ask strangers to zip me in and out of my jumpsuit."
femalefashionadvice,How do you share your whole closet at once!?
femalefashionadvice,My parka coat. I invested in an expensive one because I live in the Midwest. I use it almost half of the year and keeps me warm every single time.
femalefashionadvice,"Haha, that's how it'll happen in Quebec too, we just have to wait a couple more months.  It's funny when the weather changes so fast like that with no time to acclimate, and it's 20C, and you think, okay, this is it, this is as hot as I can possibly tolerate it!"
femalefashionadvice,Those booties are soooo cool!
femalefashionadvice,Sounds like the perfect jacket for practical use and also stylish
femalefashionadvice,They sound stunning and classy
femalefashionadvice,Your Nickelodeon jacket sounds especially cool! This is such a fantastic list
femalefashionadvice,Such a perfect staple!
femalefashionadvice,Nothing like a perfect denim jacket!
femalefashionadvice,What a collab! They sound incredible
femalefashionadvice,Love that store! Great pieces
femalefashionadvice,"I don’t blame you, it sounds beautiful"
femalefashionadvice,That is the worst when that happens
femalefashionadvice,I don’t have an answer for you but I’d write into the company and ask!
femalefashionadvice,"Ahhh thanks! I got ya, i didnt realize skimmies were compression type, shape shorts. Sammeee on the thighs. So much so that when I’ve tried this, my thighs r so fleshy it causes an unfortunate misshapen effect at the bottom of the tight undershorts. Im glad it works for u tho, nice hack fr"
femalefashionadvice,I got something like [this](https://oldnavy.gap.com/browse/product.do?pid=553042) for my vacation last month and loved it! I wanted to cover my stomach but still wanted something flattering. Everything on the market now seems to be cheeky cut!!
femalefashionadvice,Shapewear.
femalefashionadvice,"I'd take backyard BBQ just to mean sensible footwear for outdoors/grass/lawn, so something like a garden party sundress + low block heels/wedges."
femalefashionadvice,Oh no! That is a good tip! I think I'm going to give it a try.
femalefashionadvice,I have yet to get the perfect bra as well :( And I might not look it but I feel like it 💀
femalefashionadvice,Great suggestion. Thanks!
femalefashionadvice,Lands End has nice conservative bathing suits. I think they are good quality as well.
femalefashionadvice,"My understanding is that someone is home. There was a process of selecting new mods less than a year ago, there should be like six or eight of them? I’ve had responses to mod mail within 1–2 days when I’ve needed to reach out."
femalefashionadvice,"the answer to question 1 is Yes! You don’t look a bit like a sack of potatoes in that dress. For myself, finding the right bras helped a lot with the “yikes, I am a 🥔” feeling, so."
femalefashionadvice,"Need help finding swim for my mom!

So my mom (58) is going on an amazing trip to Tahiti with her sisters in April. She’s asked me for help in finding a swimsuit since she “hasn’t bought one in 20 years.” My problem is: 
A: I dislike shopping for swim for myself 
B: I don’t know places to recommend for a woman not in her 20s/30s.

She recently lost quite a bit of weight, but she dresses pretty conservatively so I don’t think she’d wear a bikini. 

Anyway, any recommendations? I’ve thought about Athleta and Albion Fit. Any similar brands you’d suggest? TIA!"
femalefashionadvice,Unfortunately I agree it's too prom-like. If the dress code is cocktail most people would expect a knee-length dress. You could get away with a long dress in a more casual kind of breezy fabric for a summer wedding.
femalefashionadvice,"Thanks for sharing your measurements! It’s always hard for me to get bottoms online because of my hip measurement, so this was super helpful. Does dirt come out of the green ones alright? I do a lot of gardening and figured I might need a black pair to keep from staining, but that green color is so perfect..."
femalefashionadvice,"Yes, it's this one!

femalefashionadvice,"I think it could work if you had it hemmed to midaxi/“tea length”, but at that length it is too prom/bridesmaid. Love love love that color, though!"
femalefashionadvice,"In the market for some quality linen (or other lightweight, but I live in Texas so must actually be lightweight) pants for summer time. I had previously bought some Caslon joggers from Nordstrom, but the quality just isn't there my thighs ate through them in less than a year.  
I liked the style of the Caslon joggers and have also seen some cropped pants from Roxy I like, the Eileen Fisher look isn't really my thing. Would like to keep it under $150 if possible."
femalefashionadvice,"Get as in “understand”? Or “purchase”?

There was already a nice constructive post on “I don’t know how to style this piece, how do I overcome this barrier?” Which has a lot of great insights IMO!"
femalefashionadvice,Where are those boots from tho
femalefashionadvice,"The rise looks too long for you because of the drooping of extra fabric in the crotch area. 

High rises come in different rise lengths, so those pants in particular look like they are TOO high rise for you"
femalefashionadvice,"I’m with you on the cropped tops! Like, so cute for summer, but why do I have to buy cropped tops year round?? I needed some new workout tops and a hoodie, and surprise! Most of them are cropped."
femalefashionadvice,"I'm (35f) going to a fancy wedding next month that, quite frankly, I have no business being at, but that's neither here nor there. I finally bought this [dress](https://www.windsorstore.com/products/ainsley-glittering-evening-gown-050020294400?variant=40180357627955&amp;flow_country=USA&amp;utm_source=google_shopping&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=Shopping+-+Brand&amp;utm_term=shopping&amp;utm_content=EC46hJuV-dc_pcrid_573464834775_pkw__pmt__slid__productid_40180357627955_pgrid_62032390710_ptaid_aud-389753374550:pla-298663229508_&amp;intent=Shopping+Brand&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiAjPyfBhBMEiwAB2CCIuOaVfkqBFSEvxVweXtrAC7JnoNp8QZzM_bluUSS0i23S3hoojb1uRoCTfgQAvD_BwE), but I'm not sure how to ""wear"" it, as far as accessories, especially shoes. Halp?"
femalefashionadvice,"I think this may come off as too prom, even if it is pretty. A shorter dress would fit in more for cocktail dress code. You may also feel out of place as not many people would wear a long gown to a wedding with that dress code unless they are a bridesmaid."
femalefashionadvice,"Already mentioned my all saints leather jacket. 
Other favorites: 
[Zadig &amp; Voltaire black ankle booties](https://www.ebay.com/itm/115133123738)
They go with jeans, dresses, skirts, almost everything. Love how they look polished and edgy at the same time and the wedge heels make it easy to walk on them all day.


[Frame Le High Flare jeans](https://frame-store.com/products/le-high-flare-dublin)
Best jeans I’ve owned. Usually I can’t find jeans that are long enough for my skinny version of Dutch legs but these are perfect. And love how comfortable they are but still have a great fit."
femalefashionadvice,"Is [this dress](https://www.lulus.com/products/sensationally-sparkly-dark-teal-green-lurex-maxi-dress/2032736.html) appropriate for a June evening wedding with a cocktail dress code? I love the color but worry it’s too long and too “prom dress.”

Thank you!"
femalefashionadvice,a pair of black Issey Miyake Pleats Please pants. i bought them second-hand and they can dress up or dress down A-N-Y-T-H-I-N-G
femalefashionadvice,"Simms challenger rain coat. I’m an outdoorswoman, on the lake every weekend/ every opportunity I have. Very pricey but it’s the best jacket I’ve ever bought that protects from the elements and also looks stylish."
femalefashionadvice,"https://preview.redd.it/avaovipgl7la1.jpeg?width=3280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=fd7391cc64347cbb4b0678f8e9fa358f78c758ac

I find whenever I try pants or trousers that are high waisted and sturdier material, I get this sort of ""diaper"" effect where they slouch around my hips but are stretched around my legs. Am I wearing the wrong size? Is this something that tailoring would fix? Or is this just the wrong cut for my body type?"
femalefashionadvice,I just went from 20 degrees to 70 and humid and it’s quite the shock! Just wait a couple months and it’ll be 100 here daily and nothing to be jealous of.
femalefashionadvice,"A versatile LBD is such a good find! I wonder if you could track it down in your current size on poshmark or something so you could enjoy it again upon occasion. I had an amazing pair of boots that I had worn into the ground, and after a couple years of sporadically looking online I found a pristine “used” pair in my size."
femalefashionadvice,"What’s your style? 

I went to Japan in December and really enjoyed shopping around Shinjuku and Harajuku. I have mostly an outdoorsy granola boho style and really liked Go Slow Caravan, Cube Sugar, and Milkfed. Not sure if those are your vibe but those were my favorites. I had a great shopping day at Lumine East (a mall in Shinjuku) and wandering the side streets of Harajuku (off Takeshita street). The 2nd street consignment stores (there’s a few location) are good for secondhand. Hope that helps!"
femalefashionadvice,It smooths out the transition from the area by the pantyline to where the thighs start to chub out. When I don't wear skimmies short shorts always bunch up by my crotch. I should add that I have very thick thighs compared to the rest of my body. If you prefer something that fits loose then you could wear slip shorts or lined shorts. But slip shorts definitely won't work with tight shorts and you would probably have to trim excess length because they tend to be rather long.
femalefashionadvice,Shorts
femalefashionadvice,"Also love my all saints leather jacket! It’s definitely in my top 3.
My mom has the Balfern and she loves it too. I have the Cargo style which works better for my body type because the fit is less “boxy”.

I’d love to have the black/oxblood [version](https://www.allsaints.com/row/women/leather/leather-jackets/cargo-leather-biker-jacket/WL145V-1215.html)too."
femalefashionadvice,Why such negativity is posted incessantly here tbh
femalefashionadvice,I always kinda suspected it was an outgrowth of sneaker/hypebeast culture that focuses on the collectible aspect of sneakers - like easier to tell that they are brand new if they are white instead of black? and also different design details might stand out more on a white background? no idea if that is the true reason for their popularity but that is the narrative I have in my head haha!
femalefashionadvice,"I'm in Canada so envious of your shorts ensemble right now. 
 I wanna wear shorts!"
femalefashionadvice,Thank you very much!!!

femalefashionadvice,The white boots in the last one 😍
femalefashionadvice,Honestly I think they'd fit right in. Love them.
femalefashionadvice,"For your second question, I think you could do either a cropped length that hits at the smallest part of your waist, or you could do a long duster cardigan (as long as it hits at or below the bottom hem of the dress).  They'd produce different style vibes, so it depends on what you like!"
femalefashionadvice,"I think for that kind of dress, a waist length or cropped cardigan would look nice. I'm afraid with a full length cardigan, it would drown out the shape. It looks really nice on you!"
femalefashionadvice,Came here to say my black leather jacket.
femalefashionadvice,"They do clean pretty easily!  I just wash the white soles with hot water and a rag.  For me, they're too warm for summer, but I also really, really hate having hot feet!  I prefer the lighter tree runners (or sandals) in the summer.  Just a personal preference!"
femalefashionadvice,"Not OP, but can I just say you are one of my favorite Redditors? You always give the best suggestions with links and explanations for why they would work for OP's needs. I learn so much from your comments!"
femalefashionadvice,"I really love your style!  I think they could go well, especially with your fuchsia/pink/black pieces.  They might clash a bit with the muted teal and mustard tones, but honestly...shoes like that are meant to be a statement, so if you love them, I think you'll rock them."
femalefashionadvice,"I can’t say I could envision them with any of these particular fits, BUT, yes, I am sure you could make these work for you. I think it’s super important to buy one or two things every season that just plain inspire you, even if adding them to your rotation is challenging, because that’s what keeps your wardrobe feeling fresh and can help prevent your style from stagnating."
femalefashionadvice,Sanuk yoga sling
femalefashionadvice,"I have the same pair but in Emerald. I got mine for 60 at REI online so it might be worth seeing if they have pink there. 
I love mine, I haven’t worn mine for running or hiking but I have for work and running errands. For work day I can be on my feet for 8-9 hours and I haven’t had a problem with them."
femalefashionadvice,"Planning a trip to Japan this summer (yay!), going to be mostly in Tokyo I think. I plan on doing some shopping and hopefully some thrifting while im there. I'm larger than most Japanese women so I'm unsure if I'll find tops or bottoms but still planning on poking around.

 What Japan exclusive or hard to get in the US things/accesories/shoes should I look for?

Any particular brand thats a ""must at least look at"" if not buy?

Any brand to stay away from quality or reputation wise?

Thank you!"
femalefashionadvice,"Question 1: Will I stop feeling like a sack of potatoes once I start clothes for my body shape/season/etc?

Question 2:

https://preview.redd.it/xlaunrxsf7la1.png?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=3c31f2bac2d42efb3a9516df99e3ad0a3c1d2f1b

I want to buy a cardigan to put over this dress. Is it better than the cardigan reaches my waist or all the way down?

Igbore the jeans, I just put the dress on for this question."
femalefashionadvice,"Oh my gosh ABSOLUTELY I think these would work delightfully with a lot of the pink especially. I’m a sucker for a good hint at watermelon color combos though. Certainly not everyone’s cup of tea, but I think definitely would work well with your style"
femalefashionadvice,"Yep, I hand wash all my sweaters but only when they need it. Bucket full of of lukewarm water + wool wash, soak, swish, roll up in a towel and stomp on it, spread out to dry on a mesh thingie on my drying rack."
femalefashionadvice,My thoughts: that I look like a potatoe in everything.
femalefashionadvice,"Purchased a pair of shoes from Italy while in New Orleans 17 years ago, I still wear them to this day. They are a gloss maroon 2.5 inch heel with a square toe and fringe front. I get compliments on them constantly and can wear to work, evenings out, or with jeans. I have never seen them anywhere else"
femalefashionadvice,I think the advantage of these is that you don’t get bulk under the arms but still get the turtleneck if you put a layered blazer or other piece on top.
femalefashionadvice,"Honestly nipple covers. The good quality ones like the Bristol 6. If you have small breasts that don’t need much support, I find these so much more comfortable all day than a bra because there’s no pressure on the mid back or shoulders"
femalefashionadvice,Thanks! That’s good to hear! I have some long sleeve tees I was wondering if I could get away with wearing underneath them. I also have a lambs wool sweater that pills! Do you hand wash yours?

I have gotten the most use out of my Zappos outlet Marc Jacobs wider leg true-blue, high waist jeans, my vintage Nickelodeon denim jacket (that I’ve gotten offers to buy from me), my real leather biker style jacket from Michael Kors (I think) that I can fit a thin sweater under and had for like 10 yrs now, any and all of my low-medium chunky heeled booties that are made from real leather or suede (a particular ankle length, low heeled cowboy booties pair with adorable star and moon cutouts has been to many a festival and traipsed all over Europe with a million compliments; they’re now in storage as the shitty camping boots), I also have a couple of a line dresses that fit really well and always look good even when I’m not into them, and I personally love jumpsuits. I have a bunch that I’ve had for years, esp vintage ones and they never fail."

[Album CCW Always!](https://imgur.com/a/VuueMfk)

I’ve been reunited with the other part of my wardrobe back in Texas, but am now missing the other half. 

[Really was wanting to wear skinny jeans.](https://imgur.com/a/QwnAmRb) I feel like they still work great with tall boots and I think with my like of tights/hosiery right now, it’s just an extension of that. 

[Have felt a bit of a shift from black to navy this season for my dark neutral.](https://imgur.com/a/tsH0SYE) I’ve been liking the softer nature of it and brown to go with some color. Back in Texas so wildly different climate than NY. 

[I can’t help but think of boats when I wear navy and red.](https://imgur.com/a/BSRQCcP) Only thing missing is stripes. This blazer has an interesting bell shape from the side. 

[Red is this season’s theme. Really was craving this dress due to the sheerness which is interesting but a little more subtle in a black.](https://imgur.com/a/OV104iX)"
femalefashionadvice,"What brand is this? It’s a pair of grey joggers with elastic band and zip up calves. I want another pair but got it from a thrift store.

femalefashionadvice,"Corset Story, from the perspective of a corset as an underpinning that supports and shapes the body, does not make a corset by that definition. They use plastic boning is the easiest thing to point to; many “bedroom play” corsets made by big lingerie houses will as well. Having never tried them I don’t feel right giving a full opinion but there are plenty experiences from other out there :) 

A quick “red flag” a corset is fashion/bedroom play is use of clothing sizes like S/M/L. A structural corset sizes by inches of reduction at the natural waist, from 16” up through 34” and higher. 

I’m wondering what you are meaning by “regular wear” in this case? It’s true a corset isn’t going to work with every style or fabric. 

Because corsets today can be fashion items worn as an outer garment, you’ll see the term “stealthing” to describe wearing a corset as an underpinning, most especially under causal baggy clothes. 

If you’d like to see how I look in mine and what I’m wearing them with, my Instagram handle is ACorsetedRarity. I’m wearing and overbust or underbust in every photo of me (that isn’t a swimsuit lol). There’s even one of me in a ribbon corset as outerwear :) No pressure, just to help our dialogue if you’d like."
femalefashionadvice,"I’m in my late twenties and I’m still figuring things out. Being able to WFH full time really threw me for a loop honestly. I’ve been struggling because I LOVE romantic/cottagecore/princess core/preppy/dark academia AND minimalist looks (so I do not have ONE aesthetic), however since I WFH I don’t wear most of those clothes. I like for people to be able to see my outfits so since no one does, I primarily wear t-shirts and sweatpants. Which I don’t love. It’s not how I imagined my wardrobe when I was in college. 

Besides that, my industry gears more towards relaxed and casual outfits so my more dressy style has never fit in. 

I’ve gotten really into thrifting since 2018. I have donated a lot back too.

However, what I do know is that there are key pieces I will keep for years. Clothes and styles I keep tend to lean either minimalist or florals. I have clothes I still wear from 2007 because my weight hasn’t ever changed that drastically and the clothes still hold up. 

To me it helps when I put things away and then pull them out again later. Usually that’s how I know if I really will stick with something or not. Or if I have something that works for a lot of occasions. 

Lately I’ve been going more minimalist and in natural fibers as much as possible. I’ve also been trying unsuccessfully to buy less. I really liked the trends during the pandemic, they really felt like ME. So I’ve been buying more since I enjoy them more. I’ll probably keep them around for longer than other things I did in HS/college that I only bought because that’s what I had access too/what I could convince my mom to get me."

femalefashionadvice,"I bought some doc martens look alike a that are laceless pull-ons on a slight platform from Zara and have gotten constant compliments on them. So far holding up well, though may need an insert at some point this or next year as I wear them a ton. They’re real leather and rubber on the bottom.

Also on my list are Blundstones and the other doc company from England with better production and a life warranty. Can’t remember the name unfortunately, but they’re about $300 a pair. 
I also have a pair or equestrian boots from Franco Sarto and others from Nine West that held up for over 8 years, probably over 10-15 at this point. Basically, if you find some staple brands from before 2008-10ish, they should be good (and get them fixed at your local cobbler!). That’s right before all of them switched to cheaper production supply lines and sent every single part to a cheaper China/India factory."

I am looking to buy a few dresses this year for some events I have coming up and found Few Moda recently. It seems like it’s a great deal even with the membership option, but I am skeptical and don’t see a ton of recent reviews anywhere.

There is a review about a year ago where some people had issues with CS and returns/refunds which concerns me. But I’m wondering if the experience has gotten better since then.

When buying online I typically buy several sizes with plans to return ones that don’t fit so a decent return/refund experience is important to me. It seems that their return policy is pretty standard.

Have any of your purchased from them recently? If so, what has your experience been? Any downsides? Any issues with returns/exchanges? How is the quality?"

Sizing up also gets you a little more room to maneuver in the toilet stall, but that’s still the main drawback for me"
femalefashionadvice,Um what
femalefashionadvice,"I recommend getting tall sizing for more shoulder room. You may need to size up too. Idk your normal sizing but I wear L generally in sleeveless things but Tall XL in blazers.

If you want a specific recommendation, I have the Banana Republic Factory classic suit jacket in Tall 16 and I like it!"
femalefashionadvice,This year I went to black / black for my outdoor running and walking shoes in winter and spring and it makes 100% sense to me to do that during Mud Season. I think it’s more practical to have white in late spring and summer when you’ve got a fighting chance of keeping them fresh-ish for a while.
femalefashionadvice,Now I need to convince my boyfriend to the same damn
femalefashionadvice,"Thank you! I think so. The long sleeved one reminds me a lot of some of the shirts my grandfather always wore, in the best of ways. The cotton is perfectly thin, but quality, the colors are pretty dark and don't show sweat, lake or ocean water, sunscreen or whatever easily. I used to wear the long sleeved one when I was a modern dancer, too, to essentially serve as a natural AC, keep the sweat off the floor and others, and protect me from floor burns. 

Looks like I'm due for another trip to the thrift store! 😊"
femalefashionadvice,"Now that I think about it, I wonder why they don't seem to be that popular? At least definitely not as popular as white sneakers. Especially considering how beloved black is when it comes to everything else. 

Even with other shoe styles like  boots or heels or sandals or flats, black kinda dominates? Like, white pumps aren't really a big thing but white sneakers are a wardrobe staple."
femalefashionadvice,"Okay- so now I want to know. Why not from a Corset Story, and how do you make it not be obvious under clothes? I tried it last year because I had the same thought as you and couldn’t really figure out how to make it work with regular wear. Thanks!"
femalefashionadvice,"I’m really late on the thread, but mine is narrrow racerfront tanks. I LOVE how they look on, cannot figure out how to wear them because the cut is too weird! Most of them cut in too far/low in the front for pretty much any bra to work. I’ve tried halter styles, strapless, cross back, it all sticks out. 

I’m small chested enough that I can go braless if I’m feeling brave, but I’m not at the stage in life where I’m going out much anymore so I’m really trying to figure out how to make these work for everyday. I’d love to be able to use them as a base layer for work, but sure as heck can’t go braless at the office."
femalefashionadvice,I also tend to get quite cold but I often wear leggings under my jeans and it helps keep more heat in
femalefashionadvice,The pink one I would use as a shell under a blazer over high waisted pants. In warmer days I could see it by itself over high waisted wide legged pants. But yeah the sweater vest looks like a layering piece
femalefashionadvice,The solution is annoying and costs money: buy tall sized ones and hem the legs. If you get it at Nordstrom’s or another store that does alterations they will hem it for you without additional cost.
femalefashionadvice,"I’ve had most of my clothes for a long time. When I do buy something (which is infrequent) I make sure it can be worn with a lot of pieces I already have. So for example my old skinny jeans finally gave out (RIP high school staple) so I’m in the market for new jeans, and I’m basing the decision on which pair matches the most shirts and sweaters in my closet"
femalefashionadvice,It is not weird to have black sneakers.
femalefashionadvice,I tuck my top in every day because I’m an elder millennial and I find that twisting the middle/front part of the hem is an easy solution 85% of the time. Also I’m chronically dehydrated so that helps too.
femalefashionadvice,"Finding a cost effective, good tailor who understands women's bodies has been a challenge for me, but definitely going to be better than keeping tons of unworn clothes around."
femalefashionadvice,I’m pretty sure all of the impractical items I can think of (such as knitwear that doesn’t cover everything) is intended for southern CA.
femalefashionadvice,"Hurrah!!! So glad you find it helpful! I kind of stumbled into it when I ordered both Long and X-Long from AE my first time. The X-Long had too much length in the leg, but they really felt better - then I compared the rise and saw there was nearly another 1"". That's what made the difference. Also, seriously impressed with AE not only offering up to 5 lengths per model, but also making sure the length is proportioned all over, not just in the inseam."
femalefashionadvice,Definitely try shortening them! If they're too close to the ground it's possible to step on one hem with the other foot.
femalefashionadvice,"Ok how easy/hard is it actually to keep **white sneakers** clean? 

I generally don't buy them bc I get the impression that it will be not worth all the trouble to keep clean, esp since I'll be using the shoes for traveling, so I'll wear it out **all day for several days in a row**. I usually go for a boring beige colour but it's not offered for the shoe model I want.

Alternatively, is it weird to buy black sneakers? Like either all black or black/gum sole. I always associate black shoes with school days when those were what we were made to wear haha."
femalefashionadvice,There's definitely an art to walking up stairs in a full skirt. (The non-art way is to bundle it up in both arms like a sheet out of the dryer... I've seen it.)
femalefashionadvice,"There’s a list over in r/ABraThatFits, along with a calculator to find your true size. I was also wearing cups that were way too small (Bs and Cs) when I’m actually a DD or E. That being said, Panache Cleo fits me really nicely."
femalefashionadvice,"Black tank top and black leggings. Staple to me means something I use almost every day and I literally wear a black tank and leggings everyday lol. Then I can change as I need to. Blazers or cardigans and some type of dressier shoe for my first job, throw a black t shirt and non slip shoes on for my second job as a waitress, something fancier if we decide to go out later for dinner or drinks. Whatever I'm feeling or doing the tank and leggings are always there"
femalefashionadvice,Heel guards and experimentation to find the brand with a good last for you (last being the thing they use to shape the shoe). For me that brand is Steve Madden as its narrow all the way through - my forefoot is not wider than my heel. Sounds like yours likely is wider than your heel.
femalefashionadvice,"I've stuck with mine for years, though I'd say that it's slowly shifted a bit over time. I had a small closet first out of necessity for awhile - no space in tiny apartment rooms, didn't make much money, and moved/traveled enough that I didn't want to keep more that I could roll by myself in an airport. Now I keep it small because I like it that way!

I wear the same things again and again. I have some neutral pieces, but most of my closet are prints, patterns, and textures. I pick the ones I find most interesting, fun, and/or versatile and wear each piece constantly. Because there are so many options available now, everything looks similar, so I only buy items that stand out to me. I actually get bored sometimes when browsing because everything starts to look the same, and so I look forward to finding the few things that I like!

I actually find it easy to decide on outfits with a smaller wardrobe. I also like to challenge myself to mix and match what I already have in new ways. Sometimes I do realize that I haven't worn a piece in a long time, even if I did a few years ago - those I end up taking out, as I buy new things. I just consign or donate them.

I'm really into thrifting now, which makes the ""hunt for treasure"" even more the focus for me. Since they have such a random assortment (unlike retail stores that always have a look or aesthetic they lean towards), it's fun digging through for a great piece at a great price. And it slows me down shopping wise lol!"
femalefashionadvice,Clothing tape
femalefashionadvice,Sunscreen
femalefashionadvice,"I have a handmade oversized sweater. It's my best staple piece, and my most comfy item."
femalefashionadvice,"With a coordinating long sleeve underneath casually, or this would be perfect for wearing at the office with a blazer in cooler weather"
femalefashionadvice,"Black loafers, a white shirt, a trench coat, a white skirt &amp; a business-passing dress!"
femalefashionadvice,I agree. I have big wide feet and I love mules. They’re very comfy to me and allow my feet to not be constricted like they are in other shoe styles.
femalefashionadvice,Stay away from those chunky necklaces that were popularized by J. Crew in 2008 lol.
femalefashionadvice,"oops, i just bought a dress from there the other day and made the mistake of not looking up reviews until i noticed it shipped from china. assuming it ends up being awful, has anyone tried making returns?

also a bummer because i was soo impressed with their size range :("
femalefashionadvice,"Adhesive bras

https://lovenood.com/products/the-game-changer-lift-shape-bra"
femalefashionadvice,"I'm tall and have the same problem, tall range is the answer and just hem them if you need. I've mostly given up on jumpsuits though because tall sizes are hard to find, also the peeing issue. If you want to try a tall size, Abercrombie or ASOS are probably your best bet"
femalefashionadvice,Ooo yes skorts r a great idea
femalefashionadvice,"Huh, I feel like adding another layer underneath would make the wedgies and riding up worse?"
femalefashionadvice,"Sheer plaid top sounds cute but I’m having trouble picturing it? Regardless: I think as an outfit the specifics of the black maxi dress will decide how this rolls appropriateness wise for a house party. Fabric, fit, print, all the way to the floor or is there a slit or something showing the boots, etc

It def depends on what well dressed is in your circle, and what the norm is in that circle too"
femalefashionadvice,"I embrace the clack. I’m a short gal so me and my loud shoes clacking everywhere (the satisfying clack, not the cheaply made clack) tells everyone I’m here and gives me a little oomph in self esteem"
femalefashionadvice,"This comment is written so evocatively. I can hear it so clearly in my head, haha"
femalefashionadvice,"Some of the models had coordinated button ups under it with jeans, which I think was working well. I think you could swap the jeans for corduroys or chinos, but not like...suit pants. You could also swap those jeans for a casual skirt. I guess that's basically testing it more like a quarter zip sweater and less like a sweatshirt."
femalefashionadvice,Maybe I’m just a black tshirt kinda chic.
femalefashionadvice,Sew in a thin strip of the non slip silicon stuff they put into some clothes.
femalefashionadvice,"I take mine to a tailor and have them put in a tiny boob gap button or two. Once I figured this out, sky was the limit!"
femalefashionadvice,"I've lived in the East Coast for more than three decades and never owned a long puffy coat, so I'd definitely disagree with whoever is giving you advice!

East Coast is going to be pretty different, weather and fashion wise, in Providence vs Baltimore vs Charleston.

I like those 3-1 winter coats with separate inner and outer layers, especially from trusted outdoors brands. It's a great time of year to look for coats, because they are all on sale, and websites like www.steepandcheap.com tend to carry all the same stuff you'd see at an REI type store."
femalefashionadvice,"It sounds like the elastic is just cutting into what I'd call ""soft flesh"", which is **totally natural** on women especially in the inner thigh! 

I'd try bumping up a size in undies, or considering laser-cut options but I feel your pain. It's like no matter what size or cut I have, it's cutting me somewhere. Hate it."
femalefashionadvice,I find it funny that I wear heels more often in winter - when all my boots have a block heel - than I do in the summer
femalefashionadvice,I think you do just get used to it. I agree with getting real metal if it’s a ring you’re going to wear every day. I’ve worn multiple rings for a while and don’t take them off while hand washing - good they get washed too!

Some notes: I sorted by size while searching so all should be available in her size or a size up, I also because it’s a wedding avoided heavily sequined or beaded options because dancing wise she will feel like a puddle of sweat later on

I love hunting this sort of stuff for people, so if she ends up having other ideas, liking some versus others but wanting options more in line with them I am happy to take feedback and run in that direction.  Obviously this is one store and so a very limited search of what’s out there so there’s certainly much *much* more to hunt down!"
femalefashionadvice,"My guess is that since it's a backyard BBQ they're trying to avoid cut-off's and other similar items. I'd go with a pretty ""church dress"" and fancy jewelry and you'll likely be fine."

femalefashionadvice,I think this depends on your body shape too. For me they look much better. I wear them with high waisted pants or leggings. Sometimes I do wear a black camisole underneath
femalefashionadvice," NASTY Gal was great originally. When she 1st opened &amp; when it first blew up. But she either sold or got absorbed up by more mainstream retailer, I'm not sure which. After that it's not the same unique item gem it was. But I'm sure she made pretty penny &amp; good for her. So if you wanted to shop the type of store you saw in series, that ship had long sailed by the time you watched the Netflix series. I know it's years later. But I watched it when 1st came out. And re-visited the show couple years later. I had heard it got canceled for budget reasons. That was only the netflix company line apparently. Out of curiosity I JUST Google the show. How I found this old thread. Now there are plenty of articles revealing that it never came back for season 2 because it was ""the worst netflix show in history"". I am shocked. I think it was the best show. I read statements like ""Sophia was unlikable"". WHAT?! She was not unlikable!! Why, because she had walls up &amp; was navigating a hard time? I loved her from the start. &amp; her journey. At time I could not wait to see what happened season 2. I was so upset when I learned season 2 would never come. I felt like the show &amp; the character grasped exactly what it felt like to be me at that time. I was nyc girl. But I felt like her Character could easily have been me. Or my friends. I don't know how closely it resembled the real life Sophia &amp; her story. But I will revisit that one season every few yrs until netfix makes it unavailable &amp; always feel a bit jipped when season one ends. Rip girlboss. You were great!"
femalefashionadvice,in that case PLEASE tell me where you’re getting these pants
femalefashionadvice,"* A cropped black leather jacket. I'm curvy and short-waisted, so I struggle with jackets being too long and boxy, but I came across a leather jacket in a charity shop and I've got so much wear with it. I love my maxi dresses and flowery prints, and it looks amazing with them, I get so many compliments and I feel like it's an easy way to add a bit of an edge to an otherwise tame outfit.  

* Following along with the jacket theme; a cropped denim jacket. I found it cheap and it was too plain for my tastes, so I've covered it with embroidery. I **love** wearing it so much and it goes with literally everything I wear. It's great in the spring and autumn when it's too warm for a coat, and it's great in the Summer evenings to pop on when it gets a little chilly.  

* I got a black croc-effect handbag on sale for TK Max which is an exact dupe for [this one.](https://mou-mou.co/product/black-embossed-leather-clasp-bag-2/) I've had it for years and it is, without a doubt, my most worn bag. It's big enough to fit my work stuff in, but small enough that it still looks chic and isn't heavy. It seems to go with everything I wear and I love it so much.  

* Gold hoop earrings with a baroque pearl, [like this.](https://www.annoushka.com/dw/image/v2/BCRG_PRD/on/demandware.static/-/Sites-annoushka-master-catalog/default/dweb14ba15/images/rollover/18ct_Gold_Baroque_Pearl_Earring_Drops.jpg) They go with every single outfit that I own and add a touch of elegance.

femalefashionadvice,"I like Mystic City Corsets for well made entry priced corsets. I don’t actually like her overbust design but I think that’s a personal styling thing. Because I wear mine so much and what I wear them under, I’ve shelled out for What Katie Did for my overbusts. 

Mystic City takes helping you find your size super serious. They have a really great Facebook group to help you get the right fit before you order. And some of the fabrics and designs she does are just gorgeous!!

The FB Group The Corset Society is also great, they have guides on reputable brands at different price tiers based on members experiences (including consumer service if you have issues). 

Hope that helps you consider dipping your toe in :)"

femalefashionadvice,Max Mara coat - I got it in Europe where the retail price is 40% cheaper. I wear it almost daily every winter and it still looks as good as new. I work in a business setting and love that it fits comfortably over my suit/blazer jackets. It’s by far the most expensive clothing item in my closet but worth every penny.

femalefashionadvice,White suits for grooms are criminally underrated.
femalefashionadvice,"It’s so fun to see everyone talking about moving away from black as default. I have to say, I’m experiencing the exact opposite. I’ve always avoided black as my colour of choice based on the idea that it’s too “obvious” or “boring” but I’ve come to realise that I look AH-MAY-ZING in black (typical dark winter here) so I am actually bringing black into my closet now with arms wide open 😅"
femalefashionadvice,"There's some really great reads about wool and the reactions you're talking about. As far as I'm aware, the general consensus is that it's to do with the size of the wool fibre (the diameter, measured in microns) more than anything else. Does your MIL knit with yarn from specific breeds? Does she go for high-quality yarn from a particular source? My knits made from a lovely hardy wool are gorgeous but unwearable on bare skin. On the other hand, I have tanks made from fine merino that feel like nothing."
femalefashionadvice,"Aldo, John Lewis in London, Schuh, Dune"
femalefashionadvice,"I think practicalities like aging, having a more professional job, and moving to a different climate have influenced me more than anything, or rather they are the impetus to cause me to look at certain new trends and adopt them. But I have kept the same general style, which was designed for what is most flattering to my body type, and my body type hasnt changed.

For example, I’ve worn a very classic look since I was in my early 20s because it worked a lot better for my body style than what was popular then (low rise jeans! God bless you those who can wear these!). Fitted waists (midi skirts and high rise pants) and being covered up works for me. When I moved to a colder climate than I was used to, I turned towards one of the trends that was/is in - dark academia, because the turtlenecks and heavy blazers offered me a practical solution that (if tailored well) would still fit in with my existing style. When I’ve lived in hotter areas, it’s been more challenging as loose around the torso is best for the climate, but I’ve been able to gather a lot of linen in almost my usual silhouettes. 

So my changing circumstances has allowed me to keep adding to my wardrobe which keeps things fresh, but my aesthetic has been essentially the same since I became an adult, although trending slightly more formal and slightly less funky and vintage as I age. But I have always been interested in clothes (literally since elementary school - I loved Claudia in the Babysitters books for all you who know who that is) and found my style early."

femalefashionadvice,Can you recommend a good bra for wide set breasts?
femalefashionadvice,"I also tend towards the classics but just bring in a couple of trendy pieces. I know they go out of style, but they serve their purpose"
femalefashionadvice,"I have similar struggles and would love to shop less. I’d love to become more of a proud outfit repeater but I find myself wanting to avoid being seen with the exact same outfit too close together so I fall into the trap (or solution depending on how you look at it) of having multiples in a similar style.

I think all in all there’s no harm in wanting fresh new things as long as we keep our consumption under control. One thing I like to do when I’m buying less is to look into the clothes I’m not wearing or I keep stored and find ways to tailor them to fit my style more today. So having a friendly tailor around can take you places! I’ve done some fun things, like shortening a blazer that was hitting me at the wrong part of my hips, removing sleeves from a jacket to turn it into a vest, or raising the waist of a dress so it falls a bit different. Anything like that can add life to clothes you haven’t been wearing and make them refresh your wardrobe without buying new things."
femalefashionadvice,"I love cutout sweaters because my back gets super overheated compared to the rest of my body, but I still want my arms and front to be warm . I wear low cut tank tops under all my sweaters though. ~

femalefashionadvice,I tend to keep clothes for a couple of years until they're either worn or I got bored of them. Used to have a cheap cardigan that lasted for up to 6 years. Buying new pieces is a once every month occasion.

Honorable mentions: cowboy boots (thrifted), moto boots (Woolrich via urban outfitters), everyday bag (llbean), interview suits (old br and JCrew factory), a tan knee length circle skirt (2012 Downeast basics)"
femalefashionadvice,"I agree that accessories make a difference. My immediate thought: red lipstick, gold hoop earrings, sunglasses."
femalefashionadvice,"I have a few:

-vintage black trench coat I thrifted for $20. Such an amazing staple that will be in my closet forever 

-a perfect fitting pair of jeans (this does change for me sometimes with body changes like being 4 months postpartum). I will always take my jeans to the tailors so they fit me perfectly. I tend to have a big waist gap at the back and I always get them taken it. 

-dr.martens 2976 Quad boots. These are my favourite boots I have ever purchased. They go with everything and will be in my closet until they wear out! 

-new balance 574 core in nimbus cloud. These sneakers are so versatile for me. I can wear them with jeans, trousers or even skirt and dresses. I have a bunch of different sneakers but I would say these go with mostly everything in my closet."
femalefashionadvice,Those purple trousers! Love them.
femalefashionadvice,"Leather ankle boots, last ages and good for a lot of situations

Some basic white converse or sneakers

In general just ignore fast fashion, but quality items that compliment a large portion of your wardrobe."
femalefashionadvice,The Comexim half cup/3HC bras are perfect for these tops- wide straps and lower cut. I’m pretty large chested so can’t do sticky bras and hate strapless bras with a passion and these bras are super comfy and work great. The sizing is different from UK/US bra sizing tho bc it’s a polish brand so rec checking out r/abrathatfits before buying!
femalefashionadvice,[deleted]
femalefashionadvice,There's a nursing bodysuit in case you're interested. I think Lively has it. I wish I bought it when I was newly postpartum
femalefashionadvice,"I got fitted again last year, but I'm still not sure it's right, so I will check out that subreddit. Thanks."
femalefashionadvice,Try the cropped knit over top that OP is talking about!
femalefashionadvice,"Misses Kisses may be an option for you. It's hard to describe what it is but they market themselves as a ""frontless, backless, strapless"" bra."
femalefashionadvice,"I find tights can be quite warm, even warmer than pants, especially if they have a high denier (like 50 or above)"
femalefashionadvice,They're mostly to keep my arms warm. My core is a lot warmer than my limbs are.
femalefashionadvice,You need the perfect boobs for them to work. If your boobs aren't big enough they don't hold up the garment and they will also flatten you even further.

femalefashionadvice,"I'm long torso plus big boobs I started sewing my own clothes specifically so I could make myself a jumpsuit that fits lengthwise. 😬😬 I've tried all kinds of things, sizing up, adding length to straps if they are overall style. It doesn't work because the torso is still too short and now my boobs are out the top."
femalefashionadvice,"I think it's so cool that you can make and repair your own clothes! And your aesthetic is also sounds very unique and carefully curated. 

I have to admit that a significant part of my wardrobe is new stuff that didn't fit *exactly* how I would like it to, or I would like the neckline different, etc

I wish I could sew and salvage some of them through alterations so that I'd love them and wear them more, but I know by now that I'm unlikely to ever sit down and pick it up. It's in an odd place where it's somewhat pricey but not worth the money to take to a tailor and have a complex alteration."
femalefashionadvice,"how long have you had the same ""styles"" of staples for?"
femalefashionadvice,This looks like it would pull your boobs down a bit with the angle of the straps? Like you wouldn't get much lift. Still though sounds way better than the oily tape removal situation
femalefashionadvice,I bought a pair of nylon parachute pants and didn't realize how noisy they'd be. I love the fit but can't wear them when they're so loud! They're currently rotting at the back of my closet
femalefashionadvice,Women are so funny lmao
femalefashionadvice,I literally have a male chest so I don't even need pasties. What's bothering me is how you keep them in place. Tube tops seem like hell if you don't want them to sag off.
femalefashionadvice,"My style slowly changes over the years but it's at a glacial enough pace that garments usually wear out before I decide to stop wearing them. Really it's more of a decision on when to stop repairing them and let them go that way.

Between the clothes I buy and the ones I make, I'm at roughly 15-20 pieces per year not including underwear and socks. I pretty much never declutter my wardrobe of anything still functional. I wear things until they die or I've changed sizes too much to wear them. I don't really run out of space for everyday clothes.

I absolutely wear the same thing many times. I'm currently procrastinating on repairing my favorite dress. It's been in my wardrobe for for near 6 years now and I need to alter the size and do a few repairs. I still think it looks good and I'm not bored. It's just not something that would really occur to me.

My style as a teenager was kinda bohemian influenced layers with prints and floaty fabrics. Moving into the college years, I had my goth phase (which honestly isn't completely over ever) and then I moved into a lot of Victorian influenced clothes in my mid to late twenties. Currently I'm in my early thirties and I'm wearing a mix of medieval influenced styles, Victoria-ish bits, goth-lite and the occasional practical everyday clothing. It mostly blends together into a weird but cohesive whole. I still mix in all my old clothes but they're remixed by matching them with new pieces. I've never been particularly into following fashion trends so nothing in my wardrobe is particularly in style or out of style. It's just it's own thing that I think looks good.

Some of the constants over the years since college have included:
-lots of flowy maxi skirts
-fitted bodices
-lots of black, scarlet, burgundy, plum, royal blue, sage, olive and ivory
-so many riding boots
-layered styles
-elaborate hats and headgear
-no jeans, no t-shirts
-embroidered details

Beyond those constants, my styles do change but they mostly still work together because they share some common ground. Keeping some constants while shifting the rest around keeps me both entertained and cohesive."
femalefashionadvice,"Yes, definitely, I've had a few random buys I end up wearing over and over. One is a pair of tan suede ankle boots picked up in tk maxx, not what I would have expected to be my style but super comfortable and somehow the colour and style seem to work with everything. I can't even find any trace of the brand so dreading the day they wear out. Also a khaki button up shirt that again I wouldn't normally pick out but I've worn it so much, whether smart or super casual or even open in summer to cover from the sun."
femalefashionadvice,"I love Portland Leather for bags.  They have two different styles of backpacks, one is more of a larger tote style and the other is more of a minimalist zippered laptop bag. On days where I’m in the office and just walking in from the parking lot, I have their laptop sleeve and tuck it into their classic medium tote. If I’m traveling or going to be working remotely, the backpack is my go too. Bags are a little pricy but they run 25% off sales, have an Almost Perfect section and if you’re near Portland - visit their store/outlet. 

So many colors and different types of leather."
femalefashionadvice,"&gt;I like to see something new and then endlessly put together outfits with it + my existing clothes.

I feel like this is really hard (for me at least) but then it does lead to less regret buys.

I'm also trending towards fewer but more expensive items, but more like 3-4x your rate. How does your buying process start? Do you get bored and window shop, or do you look at your closet and think about what you would like to add?

&gt; 1/3 is brands I really like and follow no matter what (for example, I love Zimmermann, have no idea if florals and broidery anglais are in or not these days but it kind of doesn't matter because Zimmermann is always beautiful) 

I don't own any pieces from them but they certainly have a distinctive style! I'd be shopping irl and then see a dress and think ""that must be Zimmermann"" and it always turns out to be"
femalefashionadvice,"I feel the same about blazers, I've given up, I don't really need to wear one."
femalefashionadvice,I want to know this as well!
femalefashionadvice,Last time I looked after seeing something on here they didn't ship to Europe unfortunately.
femalefashionadvice,My Etsy cart has a few rings saved but I haven’t been able to add to cart yet. Some of them have been sitting in my favorites for 3-4 years. Part of my issue is that I’m trying to purchase quality items but I’m so afraid of spending money on things I might not wear so I’m just deadlocked.
femalefashionadvice,"Yes they do, I’m 6’0 and just ordered my first long one piece suit from Aerie. When I tried it on my mind was absolutely blown. I had no idea that one pieces were not supposed to strangle my nethers."
femalefashionadvice,Not sure what to wear to a semi formal backyard BBQ wedding? I know what semi formal is but not sure how to match that with the backyard BBQ vibe.
femalefashionadvice,The knit tank tops aren’t actually hot at all. I wear mine in the dead of summer and they’re actually pretty breathable.
femalefashionadvice,"I love in the Nordics and wear mine really frequently because I layer. If it’s cold I will do a base layer, wool sweater, trench coat, and scarf. But I also get warm really easily; a thick coat and sweater makes me sweat even if it’s cold."
femalefashionadvice,I’ve heard good things about NOOD! I needed overnight so I got [this kind](https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B09DRWVG5D?psc=1&amp;ref=ppx_pop_mob_b_asin_title) on Amazon. It reminds me exactly of KT tape which a lot of athletes use. I found that using more shorter strips was better than trying to use fewer longer strips. I also cut the ends so that they are round instead of square so I don’t accidentally hit the corner of one and start peeling it off.
femalefashionadvice,"I watched quite a few, but I found [this one](https://youtu.be/DmmmghhASPE) to be most helpful in just understanding the place. I was trying to go from under my boob and up, but I had more success starting just below the nipple and using about 5 strips to continually lift upward. Then I used a strip on the side to push my breast inward. My dress was too low cut to also put a strip underneath my breasts, but that would have been perfect. 

I also liked [this video](https://youtu.be/l7EmxlMm91c) which gave a much deeper overview of the entire process."
femalefashionadvice,I’ve heard good things about NOOD!
femalefashionadvice,"The only advice I got was to absolutely be sure your entire nipple and areola are covered before applying the tape, even if it means using multiple pasties. I don’t mind just taking it right off, but it’s not pain free. I’ve also heard to take it off in the shower and use body oil while peeling it off!"
femalefashionadvice,"I'm a giant klutz and trip over anything anyway (I've also tripped over nothing on numerous occasions) so my solution is to just wear the pants I like and hang the consequences if that makes sense. I mean, I'm going to trip anyway, so I may as well trip in pants i like"
femalefashionadvice,"Beige turtleneck + wide legged yoga high-waisted pants! [These ones!](https://oldnavy.gap.com/browse/product.do?pid=724571#pdp-page-content)

Add a thin gold chain and beige Sorrels, with beanie of choice. My go-to when I wanna look fancy without doing much and still be warm this winter!"
femalefashionadvice,"I had a pair years ago that were grey silk. They were gorgeous. I wore them once because I couldn't keep them on my feet, or maybe my feet in them. I have a high arch and a high instep. After that they were just decor in my closet."
femalefashionadvice,"It's just about using your muscles differently honestly, you have to adjust your stride. I'm not sporty but I'm a very fast walker and love a practical shoe. With heels I always have a proper boot heel (which fits my style anyway) and never higher than 3 inches simply because my knees are fucked, but you still just need to learn how to walk differently."
femalefashionadvice,They’re actually your best friend! Wear pasties or go braless if you are comfortable enough.
femalefashionadvice,"I just wear a regular bra that has nice straps I don't give a fuck, and from what I see of other women on the streets it's pretty common, might be an Aussie attitude though I dunno"
femalefashionadvice,"Cargo pants. 

I love the look of nice fitting cargo pants but the only ones I can ever find either have tapered ankles or are super tight in the crotch."
femalefashionadvice,"Try buying co-ord sets instead! If you can tuck the top in, you can get the same look as a playsuit or jumpsuit without needing to strip ever hour."
femalefashionadvice,"You focus on yourself, on healing and rebuilding. Please put your energy into moving forward. Life is too short to settle for shitty love. I’m rooting for you."
femalefashionadvice,Gonna be honest that sounds hot to me lol but I get not on wedding day. Congrats on your wedding! Have so much fun
femalefashionadvice,&gt;Jessie Maed designs - super beginner friendly.
femalefashionadvice,"Adding from a knitter's perspective that these are a super quick easy knit which is their appeal, plus they make for learning how to shape a garment without the sweater investment. Some use one skein so it's great for using up your stash of yarn, esp for sock yarn. Wool (merino specifically) is also really good at not holding smells and needs less washing as a result. Combine that with the quick and budget friendly need for less yarn and the fact that there are limited options for summer knits adds to the popularity.   
T-shirts are also a hard thing to make - stretch fabrics are harder on a home machine - I'd say that these are a good replacement. It's also really easy to make and pair these with a high waisted skirt. I've seen this look on a few people who want a slow fashion ""me made"" outfit that's beginner friendly."
femalefashionadvice,This happened to me today too! Woke up thinking about these skate pants I’d coveted; did a random internet search and found them half price. Bought them before I got out of bed and now I’m excitedly waiting for them to come in the Mail :) yay for us
femalefashionadvice,Yep! Like pictured [here](https://www.amazon.ca/Silicone-Forefoot-Cushioning-Metatarsals-Breathable/dp/B084TN4VPX) but on your shoe instead of the bottom of your foot!
femalefashionadvice,"The zip+button gives my shirt a prominent fold right in the center that I have to fix if I'm not wearing a button-down lol. I do pants, tuck in shirt, belt on top because I always buy my pants too big."
femalefashionadvice,"Haha I've only used the Aldo ones and they stay! They're adhesive/gummy on the bottom, I think the only time on started peeling was after I wore the same pair of flat slides to the beach, IN the sand, like 5 days in a row. Maybe a cost/quality thing!"
femalefashionadvice,"I wear them with high waisted bottoms, whether that's leggings, trousers or a knit skirt. I wear high waisted everything because I've got a fat ass and low rise is horrific."
femalefashionadvice,"I think that honestly fitted shorts just aren't for us 🥲

I never have this problem with fitted leggings because the material is stretched and fitted across my whole leg. But with shorts the widest part is obviously my hips and that's where all the material on shorts tends to gravitate towards.

What I like as an alternate is fitted skorts, the tennis style ones. I still get the security of wearing shorts but with a flap of fabric either side so it still looks cute and doesn't show the shorts part riding up for the whole world to see

femalefashionadvice,"If you need even more height than the Jadons, the Leonas have this huge block heel. They have tapered toe box though-- I know docs are normally wide but these are definitely narrower than my tall 1460s"
femalefashionadvice,Racer back with shelf bras! Amazing! I didn't know you could get these anywhere- now I need to see if they ship to Ireland!
femalefashionadvice,"Gloves?!

I've always hated rubber gloves but IKEA has some cute colour block ones I can get behind. 

But otherwise it depends on the design of the ring really - only loose stones will get snagged off the top of my head, or a particularly spiky design."
femalefashionadvice,My boyfriend didn’t realize finding a coat isn’t as easy as saying “I want to buy a coat today” haha
femalefashionadvice,"Absolutely, it seems like an easy enough thing to find but it’s really not. I have a few 100% wool coats but they’ve all been second hand and usually vintage."
femalefashionadvice,"I lift weights so I have wideish shoulders and biggish arms and I'm having a hard time finding a RTW blazer that fits properly :( I'm not looking for a huge investment, just something to wear for a trendy look with wide leg trousers and such. Any recs appreciated!"
femalefashionadvice,White chunky oversized cardigan from Lauren Manoogian. I wore it about 200/365 days of the year for the last two years and I can’t even buy another one now that it’s worn out
femalefashionadvice,"Yes! This is lovely! Mine is similar in form, but the collar buttons up higher, and is sort of similar to u/vanillacoldbrew202. Honestly, I think it’s perfectly classy"
femalefashionadvice,"I’m on vacation in Korea and definitely thought it would be easier to find a 100% wool coat while here, but to find something you truly love is honestly a daunting task! And something that’s 100% wool? Ugh a headache!"
femalefashionadvice,Black turtlenecks make a comeback? When did they leave? Lol. If I could wear only 1 top it would be a black turtleneck
femalefashionadvice,What is a reputable but not too crazy $$ corset brand?
femalefashionadvice,A perk of being petite. No need to buy bodysuits when you can just tuck your top into your underwear!
femalefashionadvice,Where are you ankle boots from?
femalefashionadvice,"THATS SO SMART BUYING LONG PANTS FOR THE EXTRA RISE. Please excuse the all caps… me and my long rise, short waisted torso are very excited about this."
femalefashionadvice,Yes this is it for me too! I chose [this](https://www.macys.com/shop/product/calvin-klein-womens-asymmetrical-belted-wrap-coat-created-for-macys?ID=11031500) wool coat with a belt to help define my waist and I love it.
femalefashionadvice,"They're the hoodie equivalent of sticking one leg out from under the covers. I wear them with high waisted bottoms, especially during summer nights where I'm kinda chilly but I'm not *cold*."
femalefashionadvice,"Possibly wearing an incorrect bra size. I’d suggest the subreddit  r/ABraThatFits

femalefashionadvice,the knit bralette in your post is a lounge item. I don't know how you're struggling to understand when ro wear it when it's literally just a comfort-around-the-house thing because lounge had its big pandemic moment.
femalefashionadvice,Yes! I was going to suggest my go-to of bodysuit underneath any sort of top that doesn’t provide full comfort- whether due to weather/ temperature or modesty.
femalefashionadvice,"think of it this way. there will (probably) always be a version of an ankle boot that is on trend, but in the 2010s, ankle boots were also basically THE trendiest kind of shoe. that's no longer the case, and like i said before, the type of ankle boot that is trendy has changed - the heels are a different shape, and the shaft is wider."
femalefashionadvice,"High rise or strappy bikinis. I always end up with weird tan lines, but I love how they look!"
femalefashionadvice,"I tried this once and forgot I put a lil tape by the tip to hold the top in place. I ripped my shirt off at the end of the night and then cried.

Use caution."
femalefashionadvice,"It’s a great question I’m not sure I have the answer to. There are lots of different types of wool and some are way softer than others. You could ask her what kind she uses?  Merino is one of the softer ones, and baby alpaca is another. You can soak a sweater in Euclan (sp?) to soften things a little, but it could be a wool/lanolin allergy and a better undershirt might help. I don’t have any issues wearing it against the skin but that might be just me."
femalefashionadvice,"You might have a wool allergy if it’s bothering you that much. I can wear most of my handknits against my bare skin with no issues, or with a thin under layer. Do you know if your MIL is using wool though, or a blend, or other things that might be impacting you? I have sensitivity to synthetics so I don’t knit with them - a small amount of nylon in a wool yarn is fine, but I’m not buying acrylic or acrylic blends to work with, for example."
femalefashionadvice,I sometimes wear compression or bicycle shorts under my pants to tuck my shirt into. It works really well and keeps my shirt from coming untucked every time I move my arms
femalefashionadvice,"Love sandals that have the long laces you can tie around your calves, but how do people keep them to stay up? I feel like if I tied them tight enough to stay up my skin ends up pushing through the lace"
femalefashionadvice,"I totally get you on this. I've been living in my classic adidas track pants on WFH days. They are somehow more formal feeling than sweats so I don't feel the need to change pants to go out of the house. Plus, it makes it that much easier to hit the gym after work."
femalefashionadvice,"Hahah it’s actual possum fur, I live in nz, it’s quite common in some of our clothes/ blankets etc here."
femalefashionadvice,"This whole thread has me dying…you and the poster who asked about mules ought to hook up, you many have perfected the ideal outfit to make murder look like a tragic fashion accident. “I’m not sure what happened officer, my wife was walking down the stairs, her little shoe flew off and her pant leg got wrapped around the bannister”"
femalefashionadvice,This is literally why I can never own these. I CANNOT WALK. I also hate the slide scuff noise so I can’t bring myself to walk that way…
femalefashionadvice,"As someone that grew up in the one-million bracelet years, you get used to handling your hands a certain way. Same with rings"

femalefashionadvice,"Once I figured out I could wear those cropped sweater tanks over a vneck blouse, or a button up, game changer. Bonus points if the blouse is kind of a vneck with a bit of a shoulder poof, or a bit of ruffles, it just makes the whole thing perfect.    
   
Edit to say: you know those stupid see-through blouses you have, try the vests or knitted braletts over top of them."
femalefashionadvice,"I’m sorry - *possum fur blend*? Is this just a turn of phrase for some other textile component (like, a different type of sheep’s wool) or is possum fur actually used in knitwear? They ARE soft…"
femalefashionadvice,I’m tall and I’ve never found a jumpsuit or romper (or one piece bathing suit…) that fits me so yeah I’ve kind of given up unfortunately :(
femalefashionadvice,Bodysuits for the WIN. Love them.
femalefashionadvice,"Okay, you’ve convinced me, this conversation is a sign that they’re destined to be in my life 😁"
femalefashionadvice,I am in love with my IRO Shavani Jacket. Perfect for so many settings.
femalefashionadvice,I mean a black heeled boot has been in for literally foreverrr and is still popular so idk lol. Just doesn’t seem that different to me. I clearly have no idea then I guess 🤷🏼‍♀️
femalefashionadvice,their original comment was essentially a rant about how much they hate crop tops and how no-one looks good in them.

Hello everyone—I’m interested in getting a few pieces from Few Moda but I wasn’t super sure on how the membership works. I’m only interested in a few things and the quarterly membership fee of $39 definitely seems worth it; could I cancel after the first quarter during which I actually buy stuff, and then just cancel the membership renewal? So only a $39 flat rate extra?"
femalefashionadvice,"Duluth is genuinely such great quality. I'm eyeing a denim chore coat from them rn, too. Same re: the functional clothes - workwear is trendy, right?!"
femalefashionadvice,"I have this pair of Lucky Brand heeled black leather booties that I probably got.. 8 years ago? At least? Maybe 10. Brown heel and brass buttons/zipper. 

They are SO comfortable, especially for having a decent heel. I walked all over the cobblestones in Italy in them 6 years ago; I wear them all the time in the rain… they should be worn to shreds but they aren’t.

I took them to the cobbler a few weeks ago to get them touched up: heel fixed, snaps replaced, just a little fix up. I’ve been FLOODED with compliments since, which is hilarious because they’re *so old*! A lady in the grocery store actually came running up to my the other day just to ask about them. God they’re the best. It was so hard to have them away at the cobblers for a few weeks. I was miserable without them!"
femalefashionadvice,This looks cute! Thank you for the style inspo
femalefashionadvice,"A black pleated mini skirt. It can go from season to season. In the summer I wear it with sneakers and a tee. In the winter I pair it with tights, sweater, coat and boots. For dressy nights out, I wear with a silk blouse and heels. For work, tights, heels, blouse and blazer.."
femalefashionadvice,Tube tops. They look amazing but I've never tried them because they look like a pain to keep up especially since my boobs are literally non-existant.
femalefashionadvice,"They seem to be mostly sold out but they're delightful. And so much pocket space! I also have their jean jacket and their hooded sherpa lined canvas jacket. They both have man size/style inside outside and breast pockets, and the big coat has a sunglasses pocket vertically near the zipper placket. I want to be trendy which is why I lurk here but wow I love functional clothes.

femalefashionadvice,"I just got the lower heel tabi boots second hand, and they haven’t come in yet, and I’ve heard such fantastic things about how unusually comfy they are, so psyched to hear another of their shoes are just as solid"
femalefashionadvice,"Most cropped hoodies don’t expose my stomach unless they’re super short. On me, they end at the waistline of my (mid-rise) pants or slightly below. Regular length hoodies bunch up a lot in the stomach area when I sit down, even if they don’t look too long on me standing up."
femalefashionadvice,"Go back and get them :') I fucking love these overalls. I wore the heck out of them doing fieldwork 10 hours a day all throughout January in a literal rainforest and not only do I know they'll serve me many field seasons, hikes, and gardening bouts into the future, they somehow still managed to make me feel cute when I probably more accurately looked like a castaway"
femalefashionadvice,Likewise!
femalefashionadvice,"I have staples that will probably stay with me forever- skinny jeans (not ripped), leather boots, button ups and turtlenecks. They look nice on me, I feel good in them, and they can be dressed up or down and worn anywhere. I like switching up blouses and casual stuff like trendy jeans, bags and tunics vs long cardigans. I try and either buy second hand for trendy items or invest in something if it is current therefore easy to find but has timeless elements in its structure."

My MIL makes incredible knitted items, and they drive me bonkers. I attempt to wear one about once a week, but end up changing before I get out the door. Maybe a wool allergy? Is that a thing? 

Does the under shirt just have to be thicker? I have one super thick turtle neck from Land's End and that seems to help the most, but not practical for all the necklines.  

Just wondering if you have tricks of the trade?"
femalefashionadvice,"What if you accessorize it with cute jewelry and earrings or belt, scarf, etc.?"
femalefashionadvice,"Ok, this is a kind of embarrassing question.  Within the past 2 yrs I’ve gained some weight - probably 15 lbs on my 5’5” athletic (read: straight with broad shoulders and no ass) frame, and it all went to my lower midsection. So I weigh about 140 lbs. When I wear bikini or hipster panties, they feel like they’re falling off or they cut weirdly into my pants and I hate them.  Briefs fit more comfortably but are ugly. So I bought some high leg ones. When I put them on, there’s kind of a “bulge” between where the panty line ends and where my inner thigh meets the crotch area. I don’t know if any of this makes any sense. But I really, really, really hate this bulge. I’d like to know what causes it and how to get rid of it. It seems like that’s just fat (like, there’s no specific muscle right across your pubes running from one inner thigh to the other???) so losing weight would be the solution. But the last time I lost weight (accidentally, I was going through personal turmoil and lost my appetite for a month or so), I lost like 10 lbs and then eventually became absolutely ravenous and gained it all…hence where I am now, 15 lbs heavier than when I started.  Is this bugle at all related to the panties style/size? Are some girls not fit to wear high leg panties and, if so, why not? Can I lose weight and/or do specific exercises to fix this or am I stuck with this look forever??? I feel totally crushed. I’m old but not that old…close to 40."
femalefashionadvice,"So you’ve gotten lots of advice on the other stuff but just a general question to the ether… are the mods… here? Like… is anybody home to update those sorts of things like the FAQ?

I was more familiar and active with this sub’s general operating standards years ago, but this place was significantly smaller and way more creatively based than advice based then? I don’t really know the current state of affairs?"
femalefashionadvice,Old Navy Tall! Check out the Luxe Swing tops.
femalefashionadvice,Kaftans- I would love to love these but they always seems to be just a bit shorter than I’d like (I’m on the tallish side at 5’ 10”) and they do not make me look like a fabulous wealthy socialite I am aspiring to be when I wear one. I end up looking like a box on short stilts.
femalefashionadvice,"Shops which carry a variety of sizes and styles are the biggest ones for me. Namely near me that means Nordstrom is the easiest go to, but Macys is also solid for this. For some areas Bloomingdale’s may be more common, Dillards, basically: a department store is reliable for quantity of options"
femalefashionadvice,"I am obsessed with Duluth overalls, but the sweatpants ones. I have them in black and navy. Also their racerback tanks with the shelf bras - surprisingly supportive."
femalefashionadvice,I wear skimmies under the shorts. I generally fold the skimmies so they don't show and I match as close to the color of the shorts as I can. If the shorts are really short I also put antiperspirant on my thighs.
femalefashionadvice,"Questions:

- entirely black?

- conservative-ness for her clothing? Any features she prefers to highlight or hide?

- willing to rent or no?

- budget?

- what is the event? Will vary based on context/setting"
femalefashionadvice,Ohhh no buddy I actually drag the heels of my feet when I walk in them. I do not normally walk like that. Also-barefoot. I wear Birkenstocks so I just go nood footed in there. It’s easier to keep them on
femalefashionadvice,"Yes. I will almost certainly find some way to stain/ruin a white t-shirt in very short order, black tee and jeans is the way to go for me. 

I had 2 girlfriends come over this summer just to hang out and have some beverages, all 3 of us were in Jean shorts and black t-shirts. No prior planning just the go to for a casual hang lol"
femalefashionadvice,"I can’t do those no show socks, no matter the brand"
femalefashionadvice,"Hi! I'm looking for some brands that sell shirts designed for women with long torsos! I'm 5'9"" with a thin frame, and I've been having a really hard time finding tops that are long enough for me without being overly baggy. I'm 36 and work in a professional setting - not looking for all the crop tops that are out right now  ;)"
femalefashionadvice,I’m only 5’7 but I like that the pants are getting longer. I’m sick of every pair I try being floods. I’ve never needed to get any pants hemmed because they are never too long. And I’m guessing the reason why they’re being sold longer is because you can always take away fabric but you can’t add more. I do have long legs though.
femalefashionadvice,Yes CA is truly wintery this week 😂
femalefashionadvice,"I am pretty consistent with my wardrobe, at least since college, but I do feel like I’m at the point in my life where I want comfortable, well made clothing, not fast fashion. I find myself in target less and less. I also have found that I prefer the athletic chic type, which helps because I work from home (recent change) and am at the gym quite often or taking walks outside. I now prefer to have a trendy sneaker or jacket that I can just wear over my gym clothes. I don’t dress up hardly at all any more"
femalefashionadvice,"My leather jacket and wooden sole shoes. Both are  the most expensive items in my wardrobe. The black leather jacket is buttery soft and has a cool star pattern on the back, was $259 but I wear it almost everyday when it’s not super cold. My boots were $159. They have wooden soles and made of leather. The pattern is this insanely gorgeous flower pattern. Think fall colors. I try to incorporate them as much as I can."
femalefashionadvice,Patagonia is having a 50% off sale
femalefashionadvice,This was my first thought when seeing the vest. Spot on!
femalefashionadvice,"Dresses with side cutouts. Especially ones that are also long sleeve. Like, why? Why cut two holes in a perfectly fine dress?? They’re all over the place right now too. Irritates me to no end."
femalefashionadvice,"I had some from like, duane reade I think 2 years ago and haven’t been able to find them since. someone down in the thread recommended some that i’m deff gonna try!"
femalefashionadvice,"Hi! I've lived in Chicago for the past 10+ years and have grown to love my Eddie Bauer down jackets. They often go on sale for 40% off near the end of the season, and I had my first one for 7 years before I decided it was looking a bit worn out. Super warm and more reasonably priced than NorthFace or some other brands. 

In terms of snow boots -- if you're going to be out walking a lot, I would actually splurge on something good (I finally bought a pair of Sorel's and wish I'd bought them years ago)."
femalefashionadvice,Meanwhile in California I'm wearing 2 jackets because it's cold af today
femalefashionadvice,Saving this as I have SO many strapless shirts and dressed that I wear with cardigans due to always needing to wear a bra.
femalefashionadvice,"It just takes some practice, kind of like how some people can walk normally in stilettos."
femalefashionadvice,"I have tripped up the stairs several times at home in flares lol. When I’m outdoors with them on, I’m usually wearing flatform sneakers or heeled boots and that seems to help quite a bit with the tripping factor. That and the kick-walk celebs use on the red carpet lol"
femalefashionadvice,I just love how fun the silhouettes are at the moment. People are really pushing the boundaries and we no longer seem so confined by what society deems ‘flattering’ to our bodies - which leads to really visually interesting and inspiring results.
femalefashionadvice,"The only big stack wearer I know has raynaud's disease, which has purple hands/poor circulation/pins and needles as a main effect.  She had the mindset of 'if people are going to look at my splotchy hands, might as well give them plenty to see'.

Because, honestly, people will notice if they are noticeably different shades. But, you can distract with some accessories, their focus will turn to the items you picked, not the circulation you have been stuck with."
femalefashionadvice,"I have a couple of little sweater vests and live in a warm climate and this is basically how I style them! Just put them over a button up or other collared shirt and then style it untucked with a pair of straight leg or mom jeans and boots in winter, or with a mini and tights, or just the mini itself depending on how hot/cold it is. 

And the more bralette style of them is worn pretty frequently as just a bralette crop by itself where I live (Australia). If it’s mostly cotton/wool then it’s not particularly uncomfortable to wear because it wicks away sweat."
femalefashionadvice,I am only 5’7 and would say I have a short torso and still can’t wear jumpsuits. Apparently they are built for tiny people. Also with my sizing discrepancy between tops and bottoms they really just don’t work at all
femalefashionadvice,"So I clearly have a very casual perspective........

Adidas Tiro Track Pants. They are my go to for comfort and for teaching Phys Ed. and students with medical needs since there is a lot of movement and physical assistance. They also feel like the most ""formal"" obvious active wear pants...if there was such a thing. I have a few different colours but I always default to black.


Kizik slip on sneakers, the Lima's. I have a chronic pain condition and it makes a huge difference to be able to put on shoes without increasing my pain.


Lululemon Scuba oversized half zip, grey. Super comfy, flattering, versatile."
femalefashionadvice,I have big boobs. So literally everything.
femalefashionadvice,I tried wearing mine in the office and hated that it sounded like my feet are being slapped on every step haha. Hope your pair will not clack too much! Or maybe just embrace the clack as the other comment said.
femalefashionadvice,"I very much have an aesthetic that I stick to and tend to wear the same things until the fabric gives out. The only boredom-buys I do are like t-shirts for various stuff I get into. I just had a baby, so right now my stuff doesn't fit. So I bought a couple things that work for my body now and cycle through those. Once I get back to my size, I'll dig out my normal clothes. 

For me what helps is that I put all the cute stuff I want into the bookmarks on my phone. I come back to them every few months. If I still want it, and if I can afford it, I'll buy it."
femalefashionadvice,I was about to say -- where can I find these tall jumpsuits? I've never seen one.
femalefashionadvice,Do you have a brand? I like nip covers but I can’t find ones that actually lift
femalefashionadvice,"My leather jacket, Doc Martens (white ones and black ones) Reeboks classics, Levi’s 501s straight leg, a class black frame pair of Gucci sunglasses. these are my classic items I will probably own and continue to wear forever"
femalefashionadvice,"Right? I like the look sometimes. I just wear a  fitted cardigan + a tank top underneath, and do up one or two of the top buttons for a similar look but without having to buy one of those specific cardigans"
femalefashionadvice,That shirt sounds like such an incredible and unique find
femalefashionadvice,Love Combat boots!
femalefashionadvice,Maybe https://www.tadashishoji.com/
femalefashionadvice,"OP I crochet so I have about a million tops like this and I wear them on their own (I'm bad at layering). I wear them in the summer and they aren't crazy hot, esp if they are on the skimpier side or made out of a lighter/looser yarn."
femalefashionadvice,"At home, I ""solved"" this by placing a tiny ceramic bowl with a little piece of felt at the bottom next to every sink in the house. A convenient spot to drop my rings while I wash my hands or shower, and if I can't find them, I just check every ring bowl. And I also got to support local potters! 

But yeah, sometimes I just wear them to wash my hands. I figure if I ruin the plated ones that way, I can maybe justify buying higher quality solid gold. And my local jewelers does free cleanings."
femalefashionadvice,Maybe I need to accessorize. Hmmm. I will try that this week. Thanks!!
femalefashionadvice,"Rounded shoulders might help, but also roundness on the lapel and corners, round buttons, and possibly a lighter, less structured fabric!"
femalefashionadvice,"Every time I am tempted by a wide sleeve, I envision reaching across a table and the inevitable ensuing disaster. I saw someone higher up comment about long cuffs and they use elastics to temporarily hold them out of the way while they're doing a task. It might work for some of your bell sleeves?"
femalefashionadvice,"lifer on white tee + jeans in various forms.  While I feel good and comfortable in just that, your accessories could be all the difference - add a pendant or layered necklaces, statement shoes/purse, scarf, layer under a jacket/coat/blazer, tucked with a belt"
femalefashionadvice,"I have a lot of favorites, but an unexpected staple for me has been a cotton vintage ""western"" shirt. I thrifted a sort of deep teal one about 15 years ago (best $3.50 I've spent in a while) and quickly found another (short sleeved/plum). I like to add them to summer outfits especially, for a little structure/cover or sun protection. I like the fit of slimmer fit men's shirts like that on me, so I may start shopping in men's sections more now."
femalefashionadvice,"I think this depends on foot shape. I don’t feel comfortable in flats without special insoles because my feet have huge arches, and even then I still walk a bit funny. I prefer shoes with at least 1in heels and no more than 3 (special occasion shoes or platforms). I tend to walk faster and better balanced with a slight heel, whereas with flats I stumble a lot and my feet cramp faster. 

I’m also very picky about my shoes now. They have to be secure on my feet, even sandals. The heel must be thick since small heels get stuck and it’s way easier to hit a pebble wrong that sends me into a tumble. I also prefer closed toe, as  I find it’s easier to walk in a closed toe heel, but I do have open toed flats for hot summer days."
femalefashionadvice,"It depends on if you want to buy sales or if you want to buy for the season ahead the best items. If for sales, everyone is right that July is when stores offload their spring/summer stock(just like January is the time for fall winter to offload). If you want the best stuff ahead of the season, spring and summer collections are dropping about now and would recommend getting the pieces you want now that it’s early."
femalefashionadvice,I see a lot of people recommending pasties. I’ve noticed the outline of the pasty still shows throw tighter body suits/tops. (A/B cup for reference)
femalefashionadvice,Bright red looks really fantastic with tan/camel colors as well as dark brown
femalefashionadvice,Would really recommend dressing in layers of thinner things rather than a big sweater and big coat or anything like that. You do lots of walking here plus a lot of popping in and outdoors which then really sucks when you’re inside and way too hot and unable to remove the way too hot layer.
femalefashionadvice,Does anyone know how madewell compares to universal standard? Similar quality? How’s the sizing?
femalefashionadvice,"I love the texture of a knit in winter, but I get way too warm. I love my cashmere tank top, with very thin straps. I layer it under a leather jacket for work or going out. I layer that under a big winter coat in the streets lol. 

My thing isn’t a trend but I envy anyone that can wear heels for any amount of time. They are strictly reserved for date nights where we Uber to the restaurant, I’m sitting all dinner, and Ubering back. Heeled boots I’ll take the subway but only if it’s a shortish walk."
femalefashionadvice,It is so cool and you wear it well!
femalefashionadvice,"I don’t know. I actually got a heel caught in wide legs while going down the stairs. Fortunately, I caught myself with my hands on the railing and didn’t get hurt, but it could have been really dangerous.

I also think they are so impractical to wear in snow and slush. I want to keep wearing skinny jeans, but I know they are no longer in style."
femalefashionadvice,"Black combat boots (patent leather)

Blue straight leg jeans

A baseball cap"
femalefashionadvice,"I had to toss all but one pair of shorts this year due to my thighs, but I have a pair of paper-bag style (what is that name) high waisted pants with massive pockets from Express. They aren’t the cutest style, but they fit and don’t look too bad. They also don’t ride up too badly"
femalefashionadvice,"Silicone pads for the balls of your feet. They’re mostly sold to cushion the walking impact of high heels, but they work great for adding some grip to mules"
femalefashionadvice,I love Celine bags. Yours sounds really gorgeous
femalefashionadvice,I love when I find something randomly inexpensive and it turns out to be a long lasting piece!
femalefashionadvice,"Coastal grandma- sensible shoes, flowy layers, neutral colors, leans minimalist and unfussy but looks intentional and put together."
femalefashionadvice,Could you do fisherman sandals? I wonder if those would still be breathable but hide your toenails.
femalefashionadvice,Espadrilles or fisherman sandals/Huaraches.
femalefashionadvice,Stainless steel jewelry also works fairly well!
femalefashionadvice,Yeah like I am not taping my tits to go sit at a desk all day. What a waste
femalefashionadvice,Mine wanted a white suit so bad. It only came in linen though and we were getting married in October so he decided it would be seasonally inappropriate which... is probably a good thing overall but I would have *loved* to see him in a white suit
femalefashionadvice,I haven’t either and so far they’ve held up really well! I’ve owned them for about a year now and I live in SF on a hill and walk a lot.
femalefashionadvice,I'm hoping one of these days these jumpsuits from Leim take off in the US...UK woman came up with a clever way to make jumpsuits without having to take off the whole thing!  https://weareleim.com/en-us/collections/shop-all-ezp-jumpsuits
femalefashionadvice,Gah so tempted!
femalefashionadvice,"Thick black and tan (and black and tan) cashmere sweaters.  Love the fisherman style from quince and everything Nadaam.  

Stretchy Jean jacket in a medium wash. 

That green j crew jacket Michelle Obama had, it just goes with everything. 

Black Celine belt bag in nano and a similarly sized camera bag in tan from a smaller brand.  A larger-end-of-small crossbody bag is so clutch IMO."
femalefashionadvice,Thank you!
femalefashionadvice,"A+ sweet and practice brag on your husband.  

I just bought my city kid, baggy jeans, hoodies etc wearing husband some fitting pants and a nice cashmere sweater for Christmas and he loves how he looks in them.  His lil mini glow up is so cute.  🥹🥹"
femalefashionadvice,"I love a chunky-heeled boot! For me, having the shoe more securely attached to my foot does wonders for my ability to walk in heels. So, a boot that comes up at least around the ankle, or a heel or wedge with ankle straps, a slingback, and/or more structure around the foot is gonna win for me vs, say, a d'orsay pump. And avoid stilettos at all costs 😂"
femalefashionadvice,Great idea!
femalefashionadvice,"Oh great call, I love this brand but hasn’t thought of looking. Thanks!"
femalefashionadvice,"I know it sounds odd but I love my belt from [Eddie Bauer](https://www.eddiebauer.com/p/71607774/womens-pebbled-jean-belt?sp=1&amp;color=Black&amp;size=M&amp;sizeType=Regular&amp;ch=pla&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMI4LHQldW5_QIVp3NvBB2-oA_vEAQYAiABEgJNCPD_BwE). It’s sturdy, well made, and inexpensive. I’ve worn it a ton over about 2 years and it doesn’t have any crazy signs of wear."
femalefashionadvice,Username sister!
femalefashionadvice,"I feel you. I once heard someone say they don't like having their kidneys out, and while I don't know if that's anatomically correct, it resonated with me as someone who can't tolerate any of my back being exposed (as it makes me perpetually chilled). I'd experiment with layering them over dresses!"
femalefashionadvice,"I left my abusive ex months ago but I still love him. He was terrible towards me, but I built my life around him as a young adult (he was 10 years older than me) and now I feel so lost. I can’t shake this feeling that deep down, I still love him and could forgive him, though I choose not to be with him. I survived narcissistic abuse, financial abuse, physical, sexual, mental, verbal, etc. I have PTSD from the 5 years I was with him. How do I lose feelings for someone I looked over so much for?"
femalefashionadvice,"yeah they’ve definitely changed, idk what to tell you."
femalefashionadvice,lmao???
femalefashionadvice,"Can you send an example? When I think of clogs, I’m not sure how I would style them. But I could be thinking of the wrong style!"
femalefashionadvice,"I own a lot of high end stuff but: a Forever21 black very light weight blazer that I've had for like 12 years. It goes with everything somehow.

And a pair of polka dot Adidas that I got like 8 years ago because I was really into polka dots. I get so many compliments on them and people regularly offer to buy them. Plus they make every outfit a bit more fun...

I also had a pair of black vintage Prada pants once that made me look great but I lost them somehow... one of the great tragedies of my life lol."
femalefashionadvice,I love knee-high black leather boots. Perfect for day to night. I’ll have to check out those jeans! I need a couple of new pairs
femalefashionadvice,"That really does sound like the perfect LBD and for $15, what a find! Seems like you had many special and important occasions to wear it for"
femalefashionadvice,I love the Poplin Tops. They have different lengths. I have quite a  few Madewell items.
femalefashionadvice,You’re a nasty piece of work
femalefashionadvice,Those look so cool and classic
femalefashionadvice,"I haven’t tried that brand for denim, I’ll check it out. Thanks! I love having some cute hats"
femalefashionadvice,"I should try Madewell for tops, I never have purchased any from there"
femalefashionadvice,"It really sounds like the perfect top, it’s good you bought a couple more!"
femalefashionadvice,Yes good blazers are simply the best!
femalefashionadvice,A Burberry trench is sooo classy. I need to invest in one
femalefashionadvice,"I am with you, love having nice comfy pieces even while at home"
femalefashionadvice,"This is so detailed and helpful, thank you for these tips. I honestly would not have known any of this!"
femalefashionadvice,I love having go-to sweaters like that. So timeless and comfy
femalefashionadvice,A cozy cardigan is a must for me!
femalefashionadvice,That sounds very cozy
femalefashionadvice,"- Black slightly oversized blazer by La Perla. Thrifted! I wear it all the time.
- Toteme Twisted Seam Jeans in a light blue and dark wash. They go with everything.
- Straight black trousers. These I got off AliExpress for $18 and they fit me so well and are the perfect length.
- Knee-high black leather boots by Gianni Bini. They immediately elevate a casual dress.
- Classic pumps in nude and in black by Nine West. Both have a chunky heel so they are very comfortable.
- Cartier Ballon Bleu 33mm in yellow gold and steel. The mixed metal look pairs with everything and it instantly makes me look put together.

I’m currently looking for the perfect neutral cardigans! I own a few but strangely none are quite right."
femalefashionadvice,I have heard great things about Superga
femalefashionadvice,"Sephora’s spring sale is coming up in April, which is 10-20% off depending on your status. Rouges were allowed to share a 20% off code last year. 

Ulta has occasional 20% off hair tools but their sales have been less predictable lately. They do have the [platinum set](https://www.ulta.com/p/platinum-styler-1-flat-iron-gift-set-with-paddle-brush-heat-resistant-bag-pimprod2034913?sku=2602956) on sale right now. 

r/MUAonTheCheap is very active so check the old posts there too."
femalefashionadvice,Those sound very versatile and cool
femalefashionadvice,"I call them California sweaters, sweaters for winter vibes but not for warmth. Worked great when I lived in SoCal. See also the booties with cutouts."
femalefashionadvice,"So don’t wear them? Wear what you like, you don’t need to judge others"
femalefashionadvice,"I also noticed a lot more textures this time. Maybe because I'm intentionally trying to bring more texture into my own wardrobe, or maybe interesting textures are trending a bit more than they have in the past.

Agree re: gray as a new neutral, it trended really hard this past winter."
femalefashionadvice,Just one solid color :)
femalefashionadvice,Wow this is an incredible look
femalefashionadvice,Timeless classic! I never had any as a teen when they were huge but i do now and they’re so much fun.
femalefashionadvice,"Ooh that pink knit crop is super cute! I would rock that on its own with a pair of vintage high waisted jeans in the spring or early summer (or fall!). I totally get the confusion over sweater tanks but I love the unique texture option vs more traditional textures for warm weather (cotton, linen, silk). 

This is a fun thread btw!"
femalefashionadvice,He does look European thou
femalefashionadvice,"It doesn’t currently fit me, but it’s a little black dress. 

I found it at a J. Crew trunk show in like 2002. I remember trying it on over my clothes in the middle of a huge room, saying “good enough to gamble on,” because it was like $15. It was a dress from their suiting line, black wool crepe, sleeveless, v-neck, slight pencil cut with a slit in the back, just the quintessential black dress. 

That gamble paid off because— don’t ask me how, divine providence of some sort— it fit me perfectly for *years* even as my shape changed. Even when I weighed more than I do now. It came into my life at a point when I was just fumbling my way through early adulthood and needed the basics to work for me. I wore it to every interview, high stakes work situation, fancy event, multiple weddings, I wore it with thick tights and boots and a sweater in the winter, etc etc etc. It only stopped fitting properly a few years ago, which is fine, because my life hasn’t required a little black dress for some time. I do miss it, though, because it was so reliable for so long."
femalefashionadvice,"Blazers are me staple! They look less office-y and more petite friendly with the right accessories. These pins match the brass buttons well and the rubber bands help keep the sleeves up with the edges turned up to hide the rubber bands for a less lawyerly look. Exposing a bit of your arms helps reduce the stiff look and idk why helps with a petite frame.

Also I think petites can look a bit like kids playing dress up in blazers and jackets because the sleeves can be too long. Pulling them up solves that problem and looks cool.

For other blazers I add a colorful scarf. The formality of the situation dictates the material of the scarf. Work for me I’d pair it with a silk scarf (think power tie in menswear) and casual situations I’d pair a cotton one or one with more funky/edgy pattern. Or a chunky chain necklace or layered dainty ones.

Casual chic for me has been a blazer with v-neck T and jeans for years. Add some on-trend jewelry and you could wear sneakers and look classy and put together. No heels needed even!"
femalefashionadvice,What kind of witchcraft is this?! I have NEVER had these stay in for more than one wear. Is it because I  buy the pharmacy brand??
femalefashionadvice,Jumpsuits? I have to pee way too often for it to make sense. Do you really just strip down when you pee?
femalefashionadvice,Heattech leggings as well! They are thin enough to layer under other pants. I’m currently wearing a mock neck sweater dress over heattech leggings and a heattech top. So cozy.
femalefashionadvice,"I've tried talking pretty much everything and it rarely turns out well. Especially with shoes, dirt inevitably gets in and messes everything up"
femalefashionadvice,"Monteau.

I linked a Poshmark listing of it (not mine) in another reply.   Not the best photos but it gives you an idea."
femalefashionadvice,"Omg thank you, my feet are the opposite- they're short. I also have big feet for a gal so people have a hard time understanding. Often if I try on something with a strap on top of the foot it just floats awkwardly above my foot like the foot version of a bra cup that's too big"
femalefashionadvice,"I still feel like the same styles are in though, it hasn’t changed too much. But that’s just me."
femalefashionadvice,Do you recall off the top of your head what the blazer alternative is for people who are soft/rounded? Should we gravitate towards rounded/puff shoulders for our look? I just don't remember haha.
femalefashionadvice,"Totally! I use a free up called moodboard to, well, moodboard! And find it really helpful to keep track of how things look on my body, not the store model 😊 you should definitely share some outfits in the OOTD thread!"
femalefashionadvice,"Strangely enough, my white combat boots with black trim. 

It allows me to wear whatever I want on top as long as my overall outfit has some white in it, it all ties together. I lean towards monochromatic looks with a small pop of color, and these boots bring it all together."
femalefashionadvice,This is why I end up going barefoot a lot during the summer!!
femalefashionadvice,It’s VERY rare that I use it but it’s always worth it. I used it for my wedding most recently and that was last year 😂
femalefashionadvice,OMG no wonder I never seem as dressed up as others. I am not willing to suffer this much to be beautiful.
femalefashionadvice,"Superga is a great brand for a classic white sneaker as well. So minimal. 
I personally don’t like the look of Keds but the timeless versatility is undeniable. Superga is my version of that 😌"
femalefashionadvice,I bought a dark brown long teddy coat from Zara for 30 quid about 5 years ago. It’s the warmest loveliest coat and looks good with so many of my outfits.
femalefashionadvice,"I forgot about footwear! Lol of course basic black boots, summer sandals, gym sneakers are all staples … but I have had the same pair of black low top Converse since I was 16 (over 20 years) and they are sooo comfortable to this day!"
femalefashionadvice,It can stretch some things out if you go too hard on it but tbh if it can’t withstand a lil stretch it’s not the garment for me 😬
femalefashionadvice,"Old Navy does tall sizes that are amazing for this! I'm alllllll torso and I buy cropped shirts and jumpsuits from there that fit so well! I've sized up in jumpsuits but then I look a bit like a sack of potatoes, but the tall sizes fit well and are much more flattering!"
femalefashionadvice,"Can we share “I love this kind of garment and here’s how I found I could to wear it”?

I love wide neck or off the shoulder or cutouts or strapless style tops and dresses but I’m plus size with big boobs and HATED strapless bras. I worked for a lingerie company and had literal tech designers fit me. Still hated them. 

I eventually started defining my fashion and found myself historybounding mid-century, which had brought back corsetry to some degree to women’s wardrobes. 

There is nothing as nice as having steel bones and your whole torso holding up your boobs. It’s real support! (I’m talking about an overbust corset here, which covers the bust and the torso)

I know it’s not for everyone and that’s okay but I wish more people knew it was an option and gave it a shot. I find the compression comforting (someone once described it as wearing a hug) and my clothes always fit well. 

Pro Tips: Steel bones not plastic. Not from Corset Story. Cut the straps off a tank top to use as a liner under your corset; you want to sweat into a washable garment not the corset. And probably watch a few YouTube videos like Lucy’s Corsets since it is a specialized garment and there’s a lot of myths and misinformation out there."
femalefashionadvice,Classic closed toed heels with no strap or anything to keep my foot in the shoes. I feel like they’re either too tight so my foot stays in when I walk or they’re too big and my heel comes out. They’re a classic style so I feel like I must be missing something. How do people wear these?!
femalefashionadvice,A dark slouchy thick knit cardigan or platform Doc Martens. Either really make an outfit for me.
femalefashionadvice,I didn’t learn this truck until last year. Also for swimsuits?!?!? I didn’t have to peel wet fabric off and on all those years.
femalefashionadvice,success story.
femalefashionadvice,"I can't keep my bra straps up, drives me insane and if I manage it, they leave dents in my skin"
femalefashionadvice,"I don’t think it’s that the clothes aren’t feminine.  I’m not a very feminine dresser; I like flannels and jeans and combat boots (Gen X to the core).  But I’m short, and it’s hard to do oversized just right when you’re short - and bad-oversized makes me look dumpy.  

Now, when you’re a beautiful 20 year old, people can tell you are not actually dumpy, you’re just wearing fashionable yet unflattering clothes.  But when you’re 54 - there’s a strong chance you’re not being fashionable, you’re just dumpy. 

I work hard to stay in shape so I’m opposed to clothes that make me look dumpy - clothes are supposed to make me look good, dammit!

Then I remember I’m old and don’t give a shit whether stuff is in style or not because I do what I want these days."
femalefashionadvice,You CAN and should brag about this he looks incredible. You and the French salesman 100% turned your hubs into a hot European 😝 just don’t tell *him* that
femalefashionadvice,Oh! What a great compliment! And thanks for the thanks. ❤️
femalefashionadvice,"yes the taking seasonal items out of view really ups the novelty factor for me too! like, when i start thinking “i should buy a cute spring top” i know it’s time to switch out my closet to my warmer weather stuff—i might already have just the thing i want :)"
femalefashionadvice,"I feel like several pieces could qualify but I would say a black cotton-wool blend crew neck sweater from Gap. I randomly found it in a bathroom with no way of knowing who had left it so it was a completely chance encounter. 
I have a lot of stuff that i would consider “trendy” or just not as versatile as a classic solid or a simple silhouette so when I’m feeling overwhelmed abt what to wear I always know I can fall back on reliable pieces like this

Edit: that was 15 years ago and it’s still in fantastic shape!"
femalefashionadvice,"I’m gen z and I’m not gonna lie, the picture your comment conjured in my mind instantly read as “cool” to me!

i think that the effortlessness is the whole point. Looser clothing reads as relaxed and confident in a way that, in my opinion, skintight jeans and fragile blouses kind of can’t. The full loose top + loose bottoms look is definitely harder to pull off (and a lot of girls my age prefer the tighter top + loose bottoms look anyway) but even the fully loose look, when paired with some short layered necklaces, cool sneakers, and maybe some light makeup—really any kind of accessorizing that requires intention—is impossible to mistake as someone who’s “given up.” 

To me it seems that what a lot of gen Xers seem to be uncomfortable with in the modern trends is that the core pieces aren’t as resolutely and universally feminine, even though they can become very feminine when paired with the right accessories, and if that describes you I’d say that when in doubt, go with a dress!

Obviously at the end of the day if you’re happy with how you dress there’s no reason to change it. Just wanted to share why I think they’re trends in the first place!"
femalefashionadvice,"Sorry, I guess my point wasn't clear. Didn't mean to body shame. I was just saying I'd like to see my body type reflected in posts like this."
femalefashionadvice,"See how you like historical reproduction heels? The heels are thicker, shorter, and sit differently on the outsole. See brands like American Duchess and Memery. I have Lola and Marilyn from AD and it’s an entirely different experience compared to my modern heels."
femalefashionadvice,What brand is the dress?
femalefashionadvice,Okay I’m loving this call back. I’ve seen the modern version of this (cropped sweater vest over a big shirt) and never thought I had our Queen Alicia to thank for this. 👸🏼
femalefashionadvice,"No problem! It’s a little different buying leather boots if you’re not familiar with how they break in. Forgive me if you know this already. But generally, you want a pretty snug fit out of the box. It should feel like a firm handshake for your foot, is the best way I can think to describe it. But it shouldn’t be like, painful. Genuine leather stretches quite a bit, which is great once it does, because then it’s literally fit specifically to your feet and is super comfy. But out of the box they aren’t going to be ‘wearable’ comfortable and they’ll be pretty stiff. I recommend throwing them on for a couple hours at a time around the house until they loosen up a bit. Wearing thicker socks during the break-in phase can help speed things along. (This doesn’t apply to all of their shoes, as different styles use different material, and the presence of a heel might make a difference. I’m not familiar with those though.)

I’m usually a 9.5, and I sized down to a 9 for the 1460s. I wear sorta thicker socks that come above my ankle with these books, but with how much they’ve broken in, I can’t really wear anything else or they’re too loose. I’m planning on buying a pair of their Chelsea boots soon, and those I’m definitely going to size down to an 8 so I can wear thinner socks. 

Sadly, I feel like most of the negative reviews for Dr Martens shoes are because people don’t generally understand sizing/breaking them in. 

Also, sorry for the brain dump haha"
femalefashionadvice,Oh I have a coupon! I didn't know they had dresses.
femalefashionadvice,Adding another to the not for me tally. My engagement ring is sandwiched between two bands and no funny smell of endlessly prune-y skin or anything :)
femalefashionadvice,"as a girlie who can’t regulate her body temperature, I am very happy in shorts and long sleeves! my arms are always cold and pants just make me too hot. idk why, besides the fact I have terrible circulation."
femalefashionadvice,"I have a beautiful cashmere, possum fur blend crew neck jumper I brought a few years ago (I think it’s from MARLE) and it suits me fabulously. I’m a bit of a home body but I also love dressing well while remaining comfortable when I leave the house and it’s so fantastic for meeting both of those. It’s a nice neutral colour and pairs with everything. Well worth the money. But I also agree with above comments of a great staple wool coat. (Especially if it’s vintage)"
femalefashionadvice,"thank you for this! i’ve been looking for a good lifting nipple cover as I haven’t been able to find the last brand I bought (don’t even remember what it was..) I see these are water resistant, do you find they’re also sweat resistant? I typically wear them in the summer"
femalefashionadvice,Link please?
femalefashionadvice,Burberry trench coat has been on my want to buy list for over 10 years now
femalefashionadvice,That makes two of us! They’re having a big sale starting March 5 and I’d better add those to cart!
femalefashionadvice,hm have you tried the nipple covers that also lift your boobs? they’re wider than normal nipple covers so it doesn’t look like you just have large flat nipples lol
femalefashionadvice,"Same! I’m in Australia and love a good long sleeved, short dress. Great for summer evenings when it’s not super hot."
femalefashionadvice,"nipple covers! they make ones that lift your boobs up, that’s where it’s at. make sure you get sweat resistant ones!"
femalefashionadvice,"If it makes you feel any better, I have a short torso and anything high waisted pretty much comes up to just under my boobs and looks almost comical. Just so you know people on the other side have problems too!

I can wear jumpsuits though."
femalefashionadvice,"Monteau.  It's like 10 years old but googling around, I found one on Poshmark (belt is different, but you can easily change that).  Not my size but here it is

femalefashionadvice,"I have a pair I love and I think I kind of shuffle wearing them? not like, super noticeably but I definitely don’t walk the same as when i’m wearing sneakers. I think the key is to make sure they fit your foot! I have narrow feet so the mules I bought are very narrow and they have never slipped off. now my slippers are mules that are wider and I have to reallllly shuffle around the house in them lol i’ve gotten used to it though and they’re so comfy I don’t even care. though if I wore them outside i’d definitely look like I can’t bend my knees much"
femalefashionadvice,"[soma](https://www.soma.com/store/category/dresses/cat8739276/)
I love these for their built in bras and loose fit."
femalefashionadvice,"3 is my favorite look out of all of these! The proportion play with the huge boots is great, and I love that you can’t see the tops of them (must be warmer to have her legs covered too). 

She was probably thinking “this outfit is everything” because it is."
femalefashionadvice,"I'm attending a wedding in June where the attire is themed Galactic Space Garden (black tie optional), and the couple provided [these images as theme inspiration](https://imgur.com/a/LHuSylz). The wedding sounds casual as it will be at a pizza restaurant and reception at their house.

When I asked, the bride said to wear whatever, and that ""so far it's been like half of ppl just confused about what the theme means and the other half like, gonna wear sequin star suits haha."" 

[She also mentioned this as her goal](https://youtu.be/57iFg2bgSSs).

I'm all in for this theme, but I'm at a loss for where to start. Would love some ideas!"
femalefashionadvice,"Hey everyone! I’m late 20s F heading to dinner and then a house party this Saturday. I’m drawing a total blank. Right now, I’m thinking a sheer plaid top underneath a long, black maxi dress with combat boots, but don’t know if the execution pans out. 

My friends know I dress well and I’d like to keep that up (lol) while also looking effortlessly sexy. I live in the East Coast so it’ll be cold but not too chilly. I have a lot of pieces in my wardrobe so open to any suggestions!"

femalefashionadvice,I think this is it!! I do love earthy tones and soft joggers!
femalefashionadvice,Do you have a link?
femalefashionadvice,"What brand was your dress? Would love to get a versatile one for interviews, will see if I can find this one online"
femalefashionadvice,"I have a tank top knit thing like this. I have worn it on its own on a nice day as I don't run hot, but I liked it even better over a silky button down shirt as a sweater vest."
femalefashionadvice,I go to music festivals and would love to wear a cute little bodysuit like other women wear but all I can think of is trying to figure that out in a dirty dark portapotty. I’m guessing they just pull them to the side but like… it isn’t a straight stream all the time! I feel like I would have pee all over me lol.
femalefashionadvice,Just based off your shoe brands - “granola” or “earth core” may bring up some matches for you! lots of looser silhouettes and soft joggers/pants with earth tones
femalefashionadvice,The TikTok crotch gobbler shorts quest was everything my thighs needed.
femalefashionadvice,"Black leather bootie with 2” heel, just nice enough to be professional, but cute and really comfortable"
femalefashionadvice,"They have been worth it, the leather is super nice and the shoes have that ""this is well made"" weight to them if that makes sense"
femalefashionadvice,"DO NOT get anything from Faith Heart Jewelry. I got the “sterling silver” earrings for my partner and paid express shipping only to get them months later and I also had to ask for a shipping confirmation. 

When we received the product.. we already anticipated the results and that was utter crap quality. They bent when attempting to unclasp them.. yikes. Sterling silver my a**. 

We also used cleaning spray before using them, sterilizing them beforehand and they still infected his ear.. I felt so bad… but please head my warning! 

Or do you, no worries here."
femalefashionadvice,"Jumpsuits

How do ya'll use the bathroom in one of those? 

I'd everyone taking the whole top off ant pulling the entire garment down like its pants? How are you holding onto all that while doing your business? In a cramped public toilet?"
femalefashionadvice,I wear cold shoulder sweaters on winter date nights instead of off-the shoulder sweater. I could never get the off-the shoulder to lay right and generally felt cold...
femalefashionadvice,A long Burberry trench. I bought one for $900 more than a decade ago when Saks had a sale and it has served me well. I wear it every spring and fall. I like that I can drop it off at the store for dry cleaning when a season is over and for repairs (only one repair which happened recently after more than 10 years of wear). It’s my favorite item in my closet. Timeless and as close as you can get in terms of buy it for life when it comes to clothes.
femalefashionadvice,"I think I'm still at the point where I'm finding my previous bad decisions in my closet (like the $15 poorly fitting dress I bought in 2018 or whatever).    

That being said, I've almost kind of carved out two categories of clothes in my wardrobe:      
1, work clothes. I'm not terribly excited to dress for work so these are selected pretty much entirely based on function and office appropriateness. These don't go until they're unsightly due to staining/ wear-and-tear (or if they're not comfortable to wear in the office). The number is determined by the amount of laundry I can reasonably get to in a work week. The colour scheme is white, cream, black, blue and navy (unless it's a dress). The idea is if I wake up with 10 minutes to get ready, I can reach in there, grab whatever, and still look office-presentable. 
      
2, fun clothes. These do not always get worn to tatters - I let myself get bored of them. They're not strictly curated, because I usually have time to get dressed for casual things, so I don't need to pre-curate them for my half asleep late for work self.      

Pieces that drift between the two are prized, and if I get bored of them it just ends up in the work pile."
femalefashionadvice,Levi’s ribcage ankle lengths showed up in my local target and I almost passed out with excitement…
femalefashionadvice,"A black heeled ankle boot has been great for me since I started my office job five years ago - it's a perfectly good height/style to wear with pants, skirts, dresses etc at work, and also works for more formal events with nicer dresses/outfits, and is comfortable enough to wear for a reasonable amount of standing/walking (like a day at work or an evening event, wedding, Christmas party etc.) I had a faux leather pair to start and have a full leather pair now, love them!"
femalefashionadvice,Damn he looks fine as hell! He should listen to you more lol
femalefashionadvice,"I'm thinking about going to a Renaissance Faire, what's something casual, yet fun I can wear?

It will be in the 70s (Fahrenheit), and I'll likely wear jeans and sneakers. I was thinking a black tank top, but that feels so boring lol"
femalefashionadvice,"Blazers are the shit. I have a couple of vintage ones that fit me perfectly that look amazing with skirts/lingerie underneath.

I personally love a good pair of jeans.

Thick heavy duty fit every curve jeans."
femalefashionadvice,"I have no idea for this specific comment but exchanging an item is very common and this doesn’t seem suspicious but I personally have no idea and have never ordered from Riholas. I’m thinking about it; however, which is how I ended up here. Their clothes look really nice but are pretty inexpensive and so I just wondered if they really would be nice in person…🤷🏻‍♀️"
femalefashionadvice,"I neeeeed some #2 mis/matchy shoes. Wow!

The reds are amazing, #20 is amazing, and I'm so happy to see more colors than beiges and blacks. I just get so tired of 80% of everything being beige and black."
femalefashionadvice,"Check out Fly London. They have wedge &amp; platform shoes that are amazingly comfortable, for heels."
femalefashionadvice,Those types of shirts are perfect for a work at home style. But I then try and do a quick dog walk or coffee shop run and can’t get a jacket on and then I just keep my tank on and throw on my leather jacket and it’s perfect. See also my trip to get a lox and bagel sandwich today.
femalefashionadvice,They run so small I got a whole size up
femalefashionadvice,I wear multiple rings daily and this has never been an issue.
femalefashionadvice,"Empire waist: this can work if the “waist” isn’t gathered and the dress is body skimming rather than voluminous. Drop waist: same— draped body skimming skirt, not gathered, pleated."
femalefashionadvice,And definitely a more structured denim versus a more stretchy one. I remember dissecting old flares to add fabric panels the last time they were popular and that composition change definitely messed with my ability to walk fast in them. So then I got rainbow platforms and just wore those and took tiny steps. The 90s were a fever dream.
femalefashionadvice,What is a monochrome turtleneck?
femalefashionadvice,"My advice about feeling like the blazer is a costume- check out the Kibbe body type system! It’s all about harmonizing your clothes with your body type. If trench coats don’t work, maybe you have a short vertical line? Blazers might look off if they’re angular and you’re more soft/rounded. These are just examples, but whatever the case, you could probably find versions of those pieces that work for you! It’s helped me solve those issues a lot!"
femalefashionadvice,Also with flared jeans in particular I am always annoyed when the fabric rubs together and makes a whoosh whoosh noise as I walk.
femalefashionadvice,"As a petite person, I just look like a giant toddler in a jumpsuit or romper. I'm not really sure who these articles of clothing are made for. 🤷‍♀️"
femalefashionadvice,"Californian headed to NYC next week for work, and trying to figure out what to pack! It looks like the area just got some snow but there isn't any rain or snow forecasted for the time I am there. Any recommendations on generally what to bring/wear for exploring? I am hoping to only use a carry on. So far my essentials are: a [warm coat](https://media.sezane.com/image/upload/c_fill,d_placeholder_dark.png,fl_progressive:semi,h_816,q_auto:best,w_582/fbsvfp0pbxcbdi7ojbtg.jpg), waterproof/vibram-sole [Blundstones](https://www.blundstone.com/black-premium-waterproof-leather-chelsea-boots-womens-style-2241), and some Smartwool thermal baselayers."
femalefashionadvice,I recently purchased the[Nisolo Dari commuter boots](https://nisolo.com/collections/womens-boots-chukkas/products/womens-heel-boot-commuter-black) in all black and I love them! Even though I just got them I am sure they will become a staple. They are very nicely made and I imagine will last a long time. They are perfect for dressing up or down.
femalefashionadvice,i have the exact same ones and they’re my favorite shoes. they look so cute with dresses in the summer
femalefashionadvice,"Thanks!! I have 2 shoes and 1 sandal in silver and I've always liked them, metallic shoes work with a surprising number of outfits!"
femalefashionadvice,"You look cool af. Like you stepped off of Daria pre- production storyboard pages. 


Also, Ty for the work you do."
femalefashionadvice,"I’m struggling to find a style that fits my preferences, a name that I can search on google for more outfit examples. 

-comfortable, soft material

-casual

-not super feminine but moderately so (no lacey, ruffely, or sparkly bits)

-not too bold, not calling too much attention to myself, able to blend in

-practical, able to travel well

-goes with shoes that have good arch support for bad knees (right now I have Taos, Blundstones, and Chacos)


Overall I want to feel comfortable, blend in, but not look frumpy. Is there a name for that?"
femalefashionadvice,You deal with the snaps?! I’m a plus size girlie and can’t fuss with all that. I just slip the fabric off to the side and go lmao
femalefashionadvice,I wear my chunky heeled booties.
femalefashionadvice,"I'm on mobile and don't know how to link images 😔 if you look up ""blogilates corset onesie"" you can see what I'm talking about (the blue one, with laces up the stomach)."
femalefashionadvice,"I haven been taking photos! The photos are really good for remembering what my specific pieces look like on my specific body lol.  I thought since I have all of these saved outfits anyways I may as well try some of them out in a low-commitment way, could be fun!"
femalefashionadvice,"Do the hair tie trick. Here’s a video that has an example plus a couple seriously hilarious ones including one that uses your bra.

femalefashionadvice,"I got a high necked, neutral coloured knit top that worked so well, I went back and bought two more. I'm not typically a bulk-buyer, too - but I have zero regrets. It's comfortable enough to do a regular amount of walking, they're sleeveless so I'm not concerned about pit stains or overheating, they're very easy to layer because of having no sleeves, the high neck means I can wear any bra I want, it looks good with or without jewellery, it's less casual than a T-shirt, there's no ornaments to clash with anything, and they're not actually super fussy to wash (I swish them in a bucket of wool detergent + water for about 15 mins).         

Freaking amazing, these tops."
femalefashionadvice,"hi ladies! I'm starting to get an idea of what I will be wearing to my brothers wedding. im in the ""official"" grooms party photos before the ceremony and before the reception so its kind of important (im nit just a regular guest). plus its less than 100 people so I will stand out among a small crowd.

its a traditional semi-formal (i think?) in a big tent outdoors at the end of april. its in new jersey so the weather in late april is so unpredictable there. could be 50° and raining, could be 80° hot and humid.

cold/cool/warm weather - high waisted wide leg trouser. i want to get those bought and altered now and then i can mix and match blazers and tops with them when its a couple weeks out. this is my preferred outfit. have had 0 luck finding the pants im picturing in my head.

too hot for pants weather - dress. ugh. dont even know where to begin. i really hope i dont have to wear a dress but should have one ready for back up right?

oh and my boyfriend is wearing a suit cause what else do men wear to weddings so i dont want to look odd next to him in photos. this is where the pantsuit/blazer idea gets hinky. dont want to clash but dont want to look like twins..."
femalefashionadvice,"Do you have a video of this (just from the internet, obviously not going to ask you to post yourself)? I just can't picture it at all and I very much want to see this. I'm so curious because it's nothing over ever even thought of as being a possible issue. I'm just a normal walker though. Or maybe I'm not picturing how big your pants are and how stiff?"
femalefashionadvice,I love rag and bone jeans so much
femalefashionadvice,That dress sounds stunning
femalefashionadvice,"Not really, no? I make sure I move them around to wash under them properly and move them around when I dry as well."
femalefashionadvice,This is gorgeous! I love it!
femalefashionadvice,Open backs! I need a supporting bra and have never found one that works for them.
femalefashionadvice,Some kind of basic button down. I have mine from Madewell. You can style underneath or or top of something.
femalefashionadvice,"Vessi shoes, rain jacket, wool coat, wool sweaters~ Down filled jackets, heattechs~"
femalefashionadvice,Second this. My allsaints leather jacket is by far my favourite thing in my closet ❤️
femalefashionadvice,"Ahh I just got so excited about the Cosabella, especially when I saw petite. Turns out petite takes you to bras for petite/small sized boobs. The straps on the curvy bralette don't shorten much. Just a few inches on the back instead of all the way to the cup 😔."
femalefashionadvice,"To be far, I have only seen one person ever whom I thought was wearing a jumpsuit well, and this was in LA and she was very tall and very thin and could have been an actual a model."
femalefashionadvice,"I had some incredible lime green Nike dunks with hot pink, white, and teal accents. I wore them for about ten years before they started to look rough. They were the most comfortable shoes I've ever owned. I wore them with dresses, jeans, to the gym to lift, while running, pretty much everywhere.

I have a few other fun pairs of sneakers but none of them make me as happy as those did."
femalefashionadvice,I had cheap $20 flats a long time ago that were a similar style and wore them to the ground. They went with everything! Now I'm eyeing these even though it's out of my budget for RN.
femalefashionadvice,"Do you have a latex allergy? That’s the reaction I get from adhesives with latex (like bandaids). And the boob tape adhesive is stronger so the rashes will come faster and be worse. But there are latex free options.

femalefashionadvice,I can never find a comfortable body suit. I’ll be post partum soon and there will be jellies jiggling everywhere and I feel like body suits will enhance those areas?
femalefashionadvice,"1. Custom fitted rag and bone jeans. Looks great on me as a pear. 

2. Black leather jacket. It’s my go to for just a bit of extra warmth.

3. Gold and gold filled jewelry. Instantly ups an outfit. 

4. Black block heeled leather lug sole boots. Easy to match with everything!"
femalefashionadvice,"Yeah, I lugged a tote around for a year and have given up. My shoulder is sore. Now I split my work laptop out to a separate bag - these things are bloody heavy.      

If it's your personal laptop the only solution is kind of just... Figure out if you need it, or get a smaller lighter laptop. I find sometimes a tablet with accessories (keyboard) can actually be lighter than a full laptop. Not workable for me due to the work laptop, I just try to leave it at work now."
femalefashionadvice,Weird - Im 5’9 too and it’s hard to find pants with a long enough inseam - I never ever get anything shortened and am constantly having to let the hem out. What’s your inseam?

It looks great with jeans, sneakers and a beanie for casual weekend errands but also polished enough to be worn over a dress and tights.

Every single time I wear it I get asked where it’s from, which has never happened before with anything else in my wardrobe."
femalefashionadvice,I just saw some image of someone using fashion tape to stick the off the shoulder sleeve to the arm and that seemed like something worth trying.
femalefashionadvice,What boob tape do you use cause I buy the ones from target and they don’t stick on my skin. I don’t put lotion on prior either
femalefashionadvice,Love a good leather jacket
femalefashionadvice,Definitely important to have
femalefashionadvice,Those sound both practical and so classy and elegant!

femalefashionadvice,I love orange! Sounds so cute
femalefashionadvice,That sounds so luxurious!
femalefashionadvice,"Block heels with a height of no more than 1"" difference. I find the most important aspects to keeping my balance in heels is the surface area making contact with the ground. Most of my heels have a reasonably sized block and go straight down without tapering - basically the base of the heel should be as wide as possible. If they ever make pyramid shaped heels I'll be a happy girl."
femalefashionadvice,Can’t go wrong with a gorgeous cardigan!
femalefashionadvice,"A black crepe v neck bardot midi dress, from Pretty Kitty Fashion. I’ve worn this dress so many times with cream roll neck or black v neck tops underneath. Goes perfectly with lace up ankle boots, flat form espadrilles, peep toe heels etc.

femalefashionadvice,I've been enlightened
femalefashionadvice,"I have a thin cropped hoodie I wear at home specifically for cooking. The super high neck protects my chest (I'm a weenie that can't take a few oil splashes), the crop means I don't overheat."
femalefashionadvice,I could see this with a teal skirt or trousers and a red heel.
femalefashionadvice,"I've never tripped on my flare jeans, but that's probably why most models I see on store websites are wearing platforms or heels with them"
femalefashionadvice,"I have never noticed any issues, but thinking about it, it must be down to how you walk. In mules I step forward with my toes pointed slightly upwards. Then I let the back of the shoe hit the ground. Then put weight into the step. I never put the weight only into the heel though. I always push it evenly through the front and back before letting that leg hold my weight. I have high arches so the middle of my foot never touches anything. Idk if that makes it easier."
femalefashionadvice,until you sweat at all
femalefashionadvice,I think ASTR has some really fun date tops
femalefashionadvice,"But doesn't moisture collect under them and make your fingers smell weird? I swear regardless of what type of material, keeping any kind of thing on my hands when I wash them ends up with that problem."
femalefashionadvice,In the hospital there are adhesive removal wipes that help a lot. Or straight alcohol also works but much more drying. Im sure you can buy it online
femalefashionadvice,That’s what I wear with mine! I always get compliments on them. I have a few different colors that go with different outfits.
femalefashionadvice,"I sometimes wear jeans over these when it's cold, so it just becomes a top.       

(I don't tend to overheat with long sleeves, but if I do I just roll them up)"
femalefashionadvice,"Having a proper capsule wardrobe, &amp; suiting. I've not found much at the thrift/vintage shops, &amp; I have yet to find anything I can afford that I genuinely like."
femalefashionadvice,Spanx high waisted underwear doesn't roll and also isn't insane shape wear
femalefashionadvice,Im short torsoed and they even give me a camel toe half the time! It’s pulled up in there and I feel like I have to keep yanking it down and then I just don’t even wear it.
femalefashionadvice,"The most gorgeous leather jacket. 42£, more than a decade of very regular use I'm still in love."
femalefashionadvice,"Red and black seem costumey to me personally, I'd stick to jeans and gold jewelry?"
femalefashionadvice,"Looking for something, don't really need it but I want a new dress for vacation

Fun, tropical and a bit dressy for a cruise

On the line of plus, 12/14 with a mom pooch I need to hide and G Boobs so a real bra is an absolute must. I'm 6 foot which makes things harder. 

Budget around $150. I looked at Farm Rio but nothing on sale struck my fancy. Lilly dresses are far too short for me."
femalefashionadvice,May I ask what blazer specifically you got? I am in the market for a blazer right now!
femalefashionadvice,"As a tall person, def don't feel dumb bc there aren't a lot of jumpsuits in tall sizes anyway!"
femalefashionadvice,"Ah, I have super wide set boobs, mine are like under my armpits, maybe that's why."
femalefashionadvice,"Can I just brag for a second? I finally got my husband, a very “Minnesota heterosexual North woods male"" to try the monochrome turtleneck earlier this year.

We were in France and he was dead set against even *trying* one on. Never put on a turtleneck before in his life, just 100% certain he hated them, they wouldn’t work, he would die of an itchy neck etc. etc. I winked at French retail associate guy helping him and said ""come on dear, just try a turtleneck on, I promise it won't turn you into a European.""

Oh my god, the death glare I got from him when the French guy started laughing... nearly turned me into stone.

But *so* worth it.

He did eventually put it on, decided by himself that actually turtlenecks were quite comfortable and good looking after all, and ended up buying three. 

This is him at lunch shortly afterwards: [https://ibb.co/m5PhTSV](https://ibb.co/m5PhTSV)

I wish turtlenecks would make a full on come back for both men and women. Especially men in America because the turtlenecks can look *so hot* and yet the vast majority of men here are so inexplicably set against it."
femalefashionadvice,I have these too and I call them my complicated shorts lol
femalefashionadvice,These are awesome
femalefashionadvice,What awesome fashion history. Please do a podcast.
femalefashionadvice,A well fitting dress shirt.
femalefashionadvice,Those boots are so chic!
femalefashionadvice,"Thank you for making this! I enjoyed your commentary on the images. 
Obsessed with the studded heart bag. Have always loved metallics and am excited by what’s here. I didn’t know black in black was trendy, guess that’s a win for me. I like the different textures and am regretting giving away the great pleated skirt I had a few years ago, I was ahead of my time lol"
femalefashionadvice,"I have this pair of black fleece pants that fit like ponte pants but feel exactly like fleece lined leggings. Best of all, they are 100% ink black, no fading whatsoever. I too cannot link them or even find a replacement because I’ve had them for over 10 years, no tags, nothing… can’t even remember where I bought them."
femalefashionadvice,"I feel this way about a lot of these trends stemming from the 90s, and a lot of trends that were actually in the 90s. There is a point where the minimalism plus synthetic fabrics then and now just look was too cheap."
femalefashionadvice,"Re/done 70’s straight leg jeans in black/100% cotton. They fit me like a dream and ignited a love affair with Re/done, but I always come back to these. They go with everything.

I also love my Yankees baseball cap from 47 Brand in Vintage Navy. It also goes with everything; obviously good with more casual jackets like puffers, but also looks really cute with my nicer wool coats and my leather/shearling jackets."
femalefashionadvice,Those are awesome. I don’t typically care for ballet flats but these have me questioning everything
femalefashionadvice,"Chunky heels, wedges, platforms. You could start with sneakers or slim-fit boots so they don't wiggle so much, and of course inch or half-inch heels are the best place to start. Then it's just practice. You walk differently wearing flat shoes versus heels.

A weirder suggestion is exercise. High heels work your abs and quads a ton, and having more strength in those spots makes it way easier to balance. But that obviously is a bigger change than switching up your wardrobe."
femalefashionadvice,"I guess mine not be classified as “perfectly tucked”, but for work I pretty much just wear jeans and a tshirt, and I like to tuck the shirt to feel less frumpy. What I do is put my pants on as normal, take the corner of the shirt, put a finger in from the backside, twist and then tuck. Gives a great (imo) result every time, super easy, and never have to worry about fussing with it bc it takes 3 seconds to do.

I don’t have a great picture, only this one where I was taking a picture of my denim, but it shows what it looks like. Without the tuck, the hem of the shirt would fall below the belt.

femalefashionadvice,Amen.
femalefashionadvice,"I honestly had no idea that people wear underwear under them. 🫢 I tried wearing them only a few times and decided they were too uncomfortable and it was too icky for me to go all day with no cronies and a massive wedgie. 🤣   


NO WONDER THEY'RE SO UNCOMFORTABLE! 🤣"
femalefashionadvice,"I own some pretty big culottes and have never had this issue. Mine are cotton, so pretty light - I find that it drifts rather than swings.        

Could also be my stride, but I'm struggling to envision what you're describing, so we're probably doing something wildly different with our hips when walking."
femalefashionadvice,"I only use my (lone) NY and Company blazer for job interviews, and that hasn't happened lately as my industry changed the dynamics of them (now they're pretty much only zoom) since Covid.  It sits in my closet as a just in case piece. 

For formal situations, it is a dress and a cardigan.  My industry is super casual with the exception of events that call for a more formal dress code (ie fundraisers)."
femalefashionadvice,"Yes!! So much more comfortable and so much less hassle to just go braless. I get that some people just can’t because of heavy boobs/back issues/lack of support, but I’ve converted almost all my small boob friends to the braless life. If I’m not at work, who tf cares if my nipples are out?? 

Also imo if you’re wearing a wide neck/strappy top or whatever, it’s way more aesthetically pleasing to go without the bra. It just makes for cleaner lines. Obviously we should all do whatever is most comfortable for us, but so many people are married to the idea of wearing a bra even when it’s uncomfortable and unnecessary. Instead of messing with all these weird convertible bras and uncomfy strapless thingies let’s just do the simplest thing possible and scrap the bra all together lol"
femalefashionadvice,"I like them, but only for a few hours at a time for all the reasons you mentioned."
femalefashionadvice,"omg, that is brilliant. So \*obviously\* brilliant. 🤦🏻‍♀️ I can't believe I never thought of that. lol"
femalefashionadvice,I have/love these boots too! But I don’t wear them as often as I might because I haven’t gotten them resoled and I’m scared of messing them up.
femalefashionadvice,"I always had this problem too until I realized that the pooch was actually breast tissue. Lots of women (me included) have wide set breasts and never realize it. Once I got a bra with wide enough cups, I stopped having that issue"
femalefashionadvice,"I think they provide texture and grip to the ball of your foot so instead of having to curl your toes to provide the grip, your foot just naturally doesn't slip because of the increased friction."
femalefashionadvice,"I own a bunch of woollen knit tops with no sleeves (but not cropped). I wear them to work (office with A/C) with a blazer over them when it's warmish (16°C - 24°C, though YMMV)."
femalefashionadvice,Aerie sells one piece bathing suits in a ‘Long’ version!
femalefashionadvice,"I look for bodysuits without snaps. I HATE the snaps. Then I just pull it to the side for the toilet. As for the wedgie, I have some backless thong bodysuits where there is no back material to pull the thong up when I sit."
femalefashionadvice,"I have a bodysuit without any snaps, so it's just like a really comfy one piece. I don't wear underwear with it bc it would honestly be uncomfortable to do so. If i had one with snaps, however, i don't think i could get away with doing that"
femalefashionadvice,"I’ve seen multiple fashion websites recommend empire-waist dresses to the big old titty committee, so there must be  lots of busty people happily rocking them! How do I join y’all? I think they’re pretty, but last time I tried this style of dress, I just looked pregnant. What is the secret???

Also, I think 1920s/1980s drop-waist dresses are cool. How do those with wide hips pull them off without drawing a ton of attention to the hips?"
femalefashionadvice,Genius!
femalefashionadvice,I second this. I found a $1200 Makage coat on posh for 1/3 of the price and its so beautiful and timeless.
femalefashionadvice,"Keyholes help so much! It's like a crop top/pants illusion, but allows you to make the keyhole smaller or bigger to accommodate your torso. My torso is like two inches too short for most jumpsuits or bodysuits, but the one I have fits like it was tailored"
femalefashionadvice,"This. I'm on a multi-year journey of believing that my nipples (or any part of my body, really) aren't obscene."
femalefashionadvice,I wear belts with shirts and knitwear all the time lol. I guess I just got used to it? Someone here mentioned tucking your top in before zipping up your trousers and I agree it's less hassle than doing up your trousers and then tucking in.
femalefashionadvice,"I like the blue bag and yellow tights in 42! Also the green top and yellow skirt. (And I enjoy the shoes being pink, just not those particular shoes…)"
femalefashionadvice,Gettees!  made in Detroit and really good quality
femalefashionadvice,I am your size and I wear [these leggings from Ododos](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08DXHXGDJ/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) on Amazon and they're perfect. so comfy and don't slide down!
femalefashionadvice,"High quality low-heel black leather ankle boots! First was Wolverine 1000 milers about 10 years ago, then a pair of Ariat ones 5 years ago, and I just caved and bought Blundstones last year. They’re comfortable, make any outfit a little more edgy and polished (my vibe), and last forever with care and regular re-soling and insole replacements."
femalefashionadvice,To me this comment looks really silly
femalefashionadvice,"I'm guessing you mean that tucking in the tops emphasizes the muff too much? What kinds of bottoms are you tucking them into?

I don't have the same problem, but I'm a tall gal with a long torso and I only allow myself to buy high waisted pants with a really high rise. I do that so that I end up with plenty of excess fabric around and under the crotch. I just feel more comfortable that way and I like that it puts less emphasis on the booty. Example of a shorter rise/tighter hip area:

https://preview.redd.it/z9ext0nuu1la1.jpeg?width=600&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=0448a715952bad867be81c31114b2562287c82cb

[Example of a higher rise/looser hip area](https://www.asos.com/us/jaded-rose-plus/jaded-rose-plus-high-waist-wide-leg-pants-in-white-part-of-a-set/prd/202471184) (wow we can only insert one image per comment? Lame)

[And an even more flowy example](https://otbfashions.shop/products/elastic-waist-wide-leg-jeans)

Once again, not sure what you're tucking the tips into, but flowy skirts might be another good option that'll give you lots of room and won't emphasize the muff as much."
femalefashionadvice,I only do mid/narrow leg straight jeans and they’re worn with flats/sneakers/booties/wedges. Wedges are done very rarely because I can’t be arsed the majority of the time.
femalefashionadvice,It’s so cute! I’ve been going back and forth on getting it lol
femalefashionadvice,What’s the best way to style or color combos for a bright red halter bralette?
femalefashionadvice,I’m the exact opposite: I always have an umbrella in my car but rarely have a raincoat with me.  Raincoats/trenches make no sense in my car centric life.
femalefashionadvice,"[These jeans from Nudie.](https://www.nudiejeans.com/product/breezy-britt-simply-blue/) I have them in a slightly lighter blue wash. They're great, super comfy durable denim and a simple fit that goes with multiple footwear styles."
femalefashionadvice,I have a similar issue with any kind of pumps. I've never owned a pair of pumps that wasn't either too small or too loose not fall off from my feet. If it does not have a strap it does not work
femalefashionadvice,Chambray button down. It is so versatile…I can dress it up or dress it down and make it look good in so many different situation.
femalefashionadvice,Have you tried toupee tape instead?
femalefashionadvice,"Blazers with ruched sleeves are my solution to this, they're somewhat less formal but also less costumey!"
femalefashionadvice,Classic black leather biker jacket with brushed hardware. Only gets better with time.
femalefashionadvice,"Buying now is a good idea. If I decide during winter that I need new gear, I ride out the season and get it in February when I can snag it half off."
femalefashionadvice,"Not conventional, but I wear thick knit/sweatshirt bralettes in fall/winter underneath other tops for nipple coverage.   I often pair them with a zip up hoodie."
femalefashionadvice,i have recommended that wacoal bra so many times. it is perfect. a strapless bra you can dance in without it ending up at your belly button!
femalefashionadvice,"I’m still a bit confused as to how they actually work to provide support, so you don’t have to curl your toes to keep them on.."
femalefashionadvice,I have a black leather motorcycle jacket that’s still kicking after 12 years
femalefashionadvice,Cute bralette that purposefully shows through the open back or Nippies.
femalefashionadvice,Thrifted Wilson’s leather jacket. I will be taking it to the grave with me
femalefashionadvice,Love these! Thanks!
femalefashionadvice,"Bright orange long sleeve shirt with a peekaboo ^titty ^window 

Its hard to style being so bright 🥲"
femalefashionadvice,"I just get cold really easily, so I need to be layered up. High-waisted jeans don’t help much. And where I lived indoor heating wasn’t a big thing :/"
femalefashionadvice,"Yep same here, I keep swearing them off but they round my closet out so nicely and their sales are insane."
femalefashionadvice,"Well it's a button down blouse and mini skirt, which doesn't really resemble pajamas and is an acceptable outfit on its own. I don't see why a sweater vest would make it more pajama-like than it is. Not that the outfit has to be for everyone, just not seeing the pajama connection."
femalefashionadvice,"omg me too! i have a nice blazer that i never wear because it looks too much like i’m going to the office, even when i’m actually going to the office 😂"
femalefashionadvice,"A merino wool turtleneck from Woolerina. Fits like a glove, I can layer it, I can wear it with skirts or pants, it washes like a dream and is temperature regulating."
femalefashionadvice,"Me too! I wore one yesterday at work and tripped badly twice! Fortunately I didn't fall, but it was sad, I might have to get rid of them :( a friend told me I wouldn't trip as much if they were shorter, so maybe that's the secret?"
femalefashionadvice,I also don’t understand this and avoided rompers. Then a friend gave me a nursing romper which was so stretchy everywhere you could basically step out of it and pull it up like a skirt to pee. If only they were all that stretchy!
femalefashionadvice,I get those bubbly blisters and welts and am very allergic to most adhesives so I'm reluctant to try boob tape.
femalefashionadvice,"Dresses or tops with seams/cups for the bust like [this](https://www.thereformation.com/products/juliette-dress/1304968EMR.html). I think they’re so pretty and I’m constantly trying to make it work for me but either half my boob is underneath the seam and it’s just sitting there on top at a weird angle, or there’s too much gapping, or my boobs are too high so it doesn’t cover anything. How would you not wear a bra and trust yourself to move in any direction without flashing everyone?? They just end up looking so ill-fitting. Maybe if you are very thin and tall with exactly an A and a half cup size? Sad."
femalefashionadvice,"Fashion week is one of the few occasions you see statement coats out in the wild, would love to see more of these in the sea of black and grey.

Love the red also, especially the red-burgundy and red-camel combos.

Substantial jewelry is starting to dominate more and it would be fun to see more statement jewelry out and about. The dainty Mejuri trend seems to be well and truly dead at this point. I think I see some more silver in this album too. Gold has dominated for so long now so it would be nice to see some variation and fresh combos."
femalefashionadvice,"I would try Aerie. Their XXL is listed as a size 20, so size range should be good. And their leggings regularly are on sale in the $20-$40 range. I find their pants have a really good waist to hip ratio for a curvier fit. I personally really like the style that has the crossover waist, which you can find with pockets [here](https://www.ae.com/us/en/p/aerie/bottoms/leggings/offline-by-aerie-real-me-xtra-crossover-high-waisted-pocket-legging/1701_5519_073), although those are currently $38. But other styles are more discounted and could be worth a look!"
femalefashionadvice,"The good thing is that $200 coat will last you sooooo many years. It's a great investment. If you move out of the cold, you can easily sell it. I haaaaaaate the klarna/etc credit options at checkout but for a winter coat that will last me for forever? I'd think about it. 

But check for pre-owned coats of those premium well-respected brands on ThredUp and Ebay, overstock/returns on Amazon Outlet, REI's outlet, etc. I know those are obvious and lame suggestions but seriously you can't go with a crappy generic long puffy coat... so any way to get one of the well-respected brands is the way to go."
femalefashionadvice,"This reminds me of a really cute pair of shorts I got from banana republic last summer. Only to realize when they arrived that they had not one, but two buckles(in addition to the normal button fly) that needed to be done and undone in order to take them on/off. I am way too lazy for that, so they went back lol."
femalefashionadvice,I graduated as a creative writing major so I’m aiming for proofreading/editing jobs.
femalefashionadvice,[My dog and my honey's cat just hanging out in the sun](https://i.imgur.com/BVxTtzL.jpg).  &lt;3
femalefashionadvice,"I have the opposite problem, my boobs are too small to keep the top up"
femalefashionadvice,"I am a visual person and am trying to picture how these would fit. They go under the ball but stop before the toes, yes?"
femalefashionadvice,"This is somewhat infuriating but this navy [Banana Republic vest](https://www.ebay.com/itm/225317761296?hash=item3475fc3110:g:ijAAAOSwmT1jqTcP) first comes to mind.  I picked it up as an add on, because it seemed easy, and it just works.  I think it's in part because it's a kind of outstanding neutral; it's not a necessary part of an outfit and don't really wear much navy, so it plays off basics without being too much of the same. It's got a surprisingly nice hand feel, can be dressed up or down, and it's the perfect weight to add warmth in the winter but be comfy in the summer.  I wouldn't have bought it if I hadn't tried it on and I still don't think I have the kind of discernment that would find me such a wearable piece again.

Oh, there's also my H&amp;M Chelsea boots I picked up a few summers back because they were $5.  I thought I'd replace them if I liked the style but they're so comfy that they became my go-to boot and I'm still in the process of walking a hole through them."
femalefashionadvice,"Ugh yes this! I already hate using a public restroom in a jumpsuit/romper, adding another layer would be too much"
femalefashionadvice,I always look mad butch in this outfit for some reason. I love that on other women but it’s not my personal intention. Maybe if I didn’t have tattoos on my arms I wouldn’t feel that? Haha
femalefashionadvice,"A black, a brown, and a gray cardigan."
femalefashionadvice,Keep - they're sewn on so well you will damage the scarf by removing.
femalefashionadvice,"Same with the rings! I always get nervous to wash my hands when I wear only one for 2 hours (rare occasions lol), it's impractical for my job too. It looks so cool on other people though"
femalefashionadvice,"[Really basic, simple belts](https://www.net-a-porter.com/variants/images/1647597288634042/fr/w2000_q60.jpg) are in, leather with a metal buckle.  No logos, no identifying details, and not exaggeratedly thin or wide."
femalefashionadvice,I can’t find a looser fit to save my life this year and it’s so frustrating. My sizing must be weird. Even loose fit shorts are basically skintight on me at a size 29
femalefashionadvice,"I'm looking for shapewear but that meets a few special requirements:   
\- Stays in place without rolling down.... I know HoneyLove and Rago are highly recommended for that BUT also -  
\- I don't need it to be super hardcore. I'm just looking for some smoothing and light-mid shaping.   
\- I need to be able to WALK A LOT in them without them moving out of place.   
\- I need the fabric to be breathable because I am very heat sensitive."
femalefashionadvice,"Yeah, I can’t do lightweight trenches. So much material and only useful for such a short time. I prefer jackets."
femalefashionadvice,"Ballet flats do go with it if they’re modern! A ton of flat shoes do. Birkenstock Bostons, chunky loafers, slim sneakers, lug sole boots…"
femalefashionadvice,"Anything involving sandals, open toed shoes or shoes with holes in them. I have garbage ankles that require arch support and I work in a lab so I can't wear any kind of open toed shoe or shorts/dresses/skirts on weekdays."
femalefashionadvice,"I have a few really great basics that could qualify (long wool coat, black Frye combat boots, tie neck silk blouse), but I think an overlooked staple piece is a signature piece of jewelry. I have a gorgeous opal statement ring which adds that “something special” to every outfit."
femalefashionadvice,"Ah - gotcha

Personally, my fave (and I’m not good with notes, and those you’d be better off reading on the sites anyways) are 

Clinique happy for floral (daily use possible, on me it’s quite light)

CK ONE Summer for my daily use - bit more masculine"
femalefashionadvice,"Yeah, we’ve definitely got to create a culture where we push all this “but my mom belly!” shit out. It’s 2023, everyone knows what our bodies look like, it’s long past time to stop giving so much of a shit about how thin we look at all times."
femalefashionadvice,They are perfect for here in Florida weather
femalefashionadvice,"Hahah, maybe that’s it then- I’m 5’5”."
femalefashionadvice,"You do get used to it after a while. Also, agree with the person saying to get real metals but if that’s out of budget then coat the rings in clear nail polish. It wears off after a while (I used gel top coat on some of them and they’re going strong) but keeps them from turning green"
femalefashionadvice,Panniers!! Of course!
femalefashionadvice,5'1 here. They almost all go down that far 😳
femalefashionadvice,"Looking for a cotton ribbed tee to buy, but a specific type. Kind of like the picture, so generally body con, somewhat cropped, and the sleeves are NOT baby-tee length, but longer. I saw some cheap options for this but I’d rather have something that would last a while and isn’t see-through. I want it in many colors so one brand that has multiple colors would also be wonderful :)

Budget~ under $30!

femalefashionadvice,"I guess we lack the skill women had for centuries.
I have been wearing concert dresses that would wrap around my legs on stairs and such…. Then I read some advice in a historical costume subreddit. I don’t remember exactly how the technique was, but you kind swing the dress around to the sides. I got really good at doing that,  it I don’t wear concert dresses anymore and probably lost the skills."
femalefashionadvice,"The Coach city bag in black that I bought around ten years ago. It was a limited edition reissue of a vintage style. It looks classic, elegant, and effortless. Goes with everything and I get compliments on it all the time. 

More recently, I bought [these By Far ankle boots](https://www.byfar.com/products/este-boot-white-leather?variant=1111888592942). It was a splurge but I wear them ALL the time."
femalefashionadvice,"I don’t wear open back clothes as often as I’d like.
1. I can’t go out without bra
2. My back feels cold if exposed in north summer"
femalefashionadvice,Maybe they drive everywhere. Mules are so bad for arch
femalefashionadvice,"I always wear underwear with mine and didn't realize some people don't until my sister told me she didn't.... so I posted a poll on IG asking what other people did. Of around 200 responses, about 75% of people don't wear underwear with them. I was shocked! That seems so uncomfortable."
femalefashionadvice,"I use whatever bra works with what I’m wearing, usually a scoop neck or balconette bra. I’ve never had issues with it!"
femalefashionadvice,"I do this as well. I tuck into my underwear because the body suit portion is never long enough, and if I size up it gets too baggy on the top."
femalefashionadvice,"For me it’s kind of the opposite. If it’s neither too hot or too cold out, my favorite combo is shorts/skirt and long sleeves. My legs don’t get as cold as my arms/upper body, so it can endure colder weather, but also feels good when it gets warmer (I cannot stand long pants in hot weather). And I do my layering on the top - I have a sweater for if I feel a bit chilly, but over a short sleeves top if I end up being warm. My key to being comfortable is having my upper body being confortable, legs don’t matter as much."
femalefashionadvice,"Where do you like to shop and try on clothes in person? Are we all just playing the game of buying online and returning? That’s mostly what I do, but I really miss just going into a dressing room and figuring out what works for me!"
femalefashionadvice,"I think it depends a lot on where you shop.  I used to stick to the biannual clearance stuff in late June and early Jan but that really hasn't been as reliable the last few years. Now, I mostly shop secondhand which makes the start of the year the best time since people are clearing out but not everyone is looking yet, and I just sit on things and wait for good offers on apps.   If you want a good deal I think something equivalent like using Shopify and getting alerted once things are comfortably discounted probably makes the most sense."
femalefashionadvice,"Damn, how long is everyone’s shirts?! I even wear high waisted underwear and there’s no way. Maybe I just have a long torso"
femalefashionadvice,"I feel like I need to have a list of perfumes by category to go and actually smell. Like, X is a good example of a citrusy fragrance, Y is good for florals, etc to figure out which ones I actually like."
femalefashionadvice,"I'm dissing your own style and taste but to me that outfit looks really silly and I feel like if I tried it, I would feel like I'm still wearing my pyjamas under a small jumper or something?"
femalefashionadvice,I want those black boots on 19!
femalefashionadvice,"To kind of add to this question, I've got horrible circulation and my hands are pretty much always purple-ish. I've got a few rings that I love but I'm worried that wearing them will only draw attention to my corpse-like hands. Has anyone else with poor circulation found a way around this? I don't know what is wrong with my skin, but I've tried just about every self tanner there is in existence, and they never, ever work on me. I know that I could just wear the rings and not care about it, but I'd still feel self-conscious."
femalefashionadvice,"I'm in agreement. I can do boob tape, but I'm not willing to put in the effort of putting taping on *and* the pain of taking it off for frequent casual wear. A backless gown for a formal event? Sure. A cute cutout summer dress for a first date? Okay I'll think about it. A random sweater on a Tuesday, that should have been office-appropriate except for a weird back cutout for *no* reason? No thanks.

To that end, cutout sweaters in general. You're wearing a sweater, that means it's cold. Why then is it backless??"
femalefashionadvice,Yeah I wonder this too. I think my feet are too narrow for mules.
femalefashionadvice,They’re the perfect piece to make any outfit look extra cool
femalefashionadvice,Judging by my 71 up votes apparently yes
femalefashionadvice,I’m really attached to mine too :)
femalefashionadvice,I love it! It’s timeless and beautiful. Does well in rain as well
femalefashionadvice,"Hmm, I live in the deep south and don’t have an issue with knit crop tops in the summer. With your arms free, it’s just not that hot IMO."
femalefashionadvice,"I glanced through r/fragrance and got intimidated, haha. But I think once I do a little more investigation about my personal preferences then I'll be better able to utilize their guides."
femalefashionadvice,"... wait, what? Are some people actually zipping up and THEN tucking?"
femalefashionadvice,I felt really guilty about getting them even though they were on sale but they're on track to paying for themselves through daily wear
femalefashionadvice,"I feel like it’s so rare now outside of vintage. 

Okay but really second honorable mentions to my oversized trench coats in [black](https://clothbase.com/items/d2babcda_toteme-black-pisa-trench-coat_toteme) and [the perfect khaki.](https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/shop/product/oversized-trench-coat-10344446). I have way too much attachment to my staples to just pick one."
femalefashionadvice,"I totally get it, I’ve heard great things about Duluth!"
femalefashionadvice,"Okay I’m 5’4” but heavier, I’m built like a lord of the rings dwarf except the width makes me look shorter than I am. The trick with this is to make sure everything else you choose is elongating.

Pointed toe neutral shoes with a slight heel, a high waisted straight leg jean, a tee, and an oversized blazer left loose make you look so much longer in your proportions that the extra oversized blazer looks purposefully juxtaposed rather than “kid got into dads closet”"
femalefashionadvice,I feel so lucky that I stumbled upon them 🥹🥹
femalefashionadvice,"I always take them off when I wash my hands, and put them back on afterwards; honestly, it has never bothered me :/ but I do opt for designs that do not snag on things (or my hair)"
femalefashionadvice,A Burberry trench sounds fabulous
femalefashionadvice,I am so with you on the black blazer
femalefashionadvice,"Hear me out: I do a lot of fieldwork and general outdoors stuff. I recently bought a pair of gardening overalls from Duluth Trading Co. and I LOVE them - perfect for everything outdoors, lightweight for warm weather, and cute to wear in other contexts if you're a little crunchy 😅 a staple for my outdoors wardrobe!  https://www.duluthtrading.com/womens-heirloom-gardening-bib-overalls-16760.html"
femalefashionadvice,Those are so fun and also stunning!
femalefashionadvice,"Yeah, I also have a long, fast stride like OP, and I don't think I've ever tripped in jeans. Knits, definitely."
femalefashionadvice,The Dickies sound very cool!
femalefashionadvice,"- Burberry Trench Coat, it’s done me so well for over 10 years and looks the same.

- Shimmery evening gown, always gets compliments. Once went to an event and another lady had the same dress and we had an awesome photoshoot

- Leather ankle boots, they can be formal or informal, they last long and are comfortable"
femalefashionadvice,Black blazer.
femalefashionadvice,"It was a BIG splurge for me, but I purchased these Tory Burch flats with the hammered circles on them and they weirdly go with a good 90% of my wardrobe.

femalefashionadvice,"No one mentioned high heels? :O 

Also, shoulder bags... I carry my laptop around (what if I need it?!) and shoulder bags that can accommodate it are 1) ugly 2) become waaay to heavy so I always stick with an (ugly) backpack..."
femalefashionadvice,"Girl I'm a member of the anti nipping club regardless of boob size. I get that bigger chests actually need the support too but basically my barely B cup and I are with you on the bra train...

I just feel naked if the top doesn't have a thick lining or something between me and the world.

Echoing boob tape and sticky bras/pasties. There's also tons of creative bra things I've seen on Amazon. They're great for even just a laugh when you're just meandering around your phone anyway. 

Like seriously, how did this thing even work? Amazon: Lesome Push up Frontless Bra Kit Wire,Deep Plunge Bra Kit Silicone Cover for Sweetheart Necklines Beige"
femalefashionadvice,Check Target's belt selection online.  I've noticed they're a weirdly good touchstone in that any time a style is popular they seem to have their versions of it pretty immediately.
femalefashionadvice,"Size up, basically. The stretch of the fabric will help it conform and not be too loose. But it will resolve 85% of those fit issues."
femalefashionadvice,"As a pear shaped lady who does a lot of squats, I took my favorite 501 Levi cutoff shorts and cut a small  slit along the seam because my new leg gains were making my shorts roll up all the time.

Worked perfectly and cost $0!!"
femalefashionadvice,"Yes you do, cause oh god the snaps sound so uncomfy then ick 

I still wash them very frequently, if not the whole shabang then certainly hand wash that area and hang to dry. I had a friend who got yeast infections a couple times, she thought it was from not washing them often enough, and I decided to learn from her mistake 

I find that often double layered body suits I don’t need a bra with (babaton ones in particular), and it still isn’t a safety hazard to have em flyin around, which as a DD is… a precious resource to be held in the highest regard 100% worth finagling with a snap in my snap after I pee. A few moments of annoyance for a hundred moments of beautiful braless bliss? Take my money"
femalefashionadvice,"High waisted pants, autumn, spring, summer evenings

Tbh I love cropped sweaters and hoodies and have never really faced this issue. The few inches of exposed stomach doesn't really matter inside and outside ofc would wear a jacket if needed"

femalefashionadvice,"Yes!

I have several leather jackets, but my holographic Mackage jacket gets the most abuse. It’s rainbow/silver (like an oil slick) with gold hardware - it matches everything!

One day I’ll pony up for ALLSAINTS. I used to pop into their store in Las Vegas and just pretend that everything was mine 😅"
femalefashionadvice,I’ve never seen this and I love it — it solves so many problems?? Do you notice any issues with fit or do you use a specific bra with it?
femalefashionadvice,"Oh god yes. I tripped once wearing these and carrying couple of beers in the shopping bag, bottles broke, of course, and I found myself lying in the middle of the pool of smelly liquid. Not my proudest moment lol"
femalefashionadvice,you’ve missed the point of this post
femalefashionadvice,I’m all about the monochrome cashmere turtleneck 👀👀 have a few that I thrifted and have worn for years. Also vintage Dickies - b&amp;w checkered pattern — cute with everything from a crop top to a band t to a blazer
femalefashionadvice,what’s your inseam measurement?
femalefashionadvice,"It's a great time of year to be looking for this kind of thing.  Not sure exactly how cold your winters are gonna be but I'd recommend just looking at the kind of go-to outdoor, older clientele type brands secondhand.  Personally, I have an excellent Land's End puffer that I got for a song and a prayer and is laughably warm even though I only wear it during the coldest days, and I've frequently seen similar styles on Poshmark for in excellent condition for around $70.

As for not going bankrupt, I'd say focus on quality, have multiple of base layers, resign yourself to fewer outer layers that you rotate.  So a week or two worth of whatever is touching your body (Uniqlo heatech is the popular choice but I'm a spaghetti tank+heavyweight turtleneck+sweater tight kind of person myself,) 2-3 sweaters/pants that you can wear stuff under that you rotate, and a good coat to start out (it's a practical item no one will look at you twice.)  Though I don't dress similarly, I always likes [Clothesnbits' Winter Layering series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLb4k4nLPCEKf3_fyByg3N3zVWJEmasTUU) to get an idea of how you wanna go about it."
femalefashionadvice,"What preferences do you have though? Any that you smell that catch your fancy/nose? 

I like one of the suggestions on your thread - samples. But even to narrow those down - some idea of what YOU like, would be good

A story from my own life, and why I feel your pain: back when I first started to even be able to buy perfumes, I used to love Davidoff. Then I bought a bottle and yuck! It smelled horrid on me. Meanwhile, a person I knew - smelled like a dream on her. Argh."
femalefashionadvice,"So there’s a few things with trench coats that are sort of the way they are because of the way they started. 

They were never intended as a solo thing, more like… a windbreaker/raincoat work with layering for warmth underneath. Historically, they popped up as a style pre-world war one, and when Burberry began using gabardine they took their waterproof windbreaker to the military, and were so helpful they became a staple in the trenches and thus became the trench coat. They were eventually marketed as being sold oversized to be worn over the “British Warm” which was a wool overcoat style of officers that became popular because of WWI. Though trenches were popular they were not provided or required, but were acceptable parts of the uniform which meant it needed some stuff other coats for the public didn’t. The reason for all the straps was for regalia and necessary gear to still be on the outside of your coat. Flaps and vents to air ya out so you’re not BO-ing up the place, huge pockets for more gear and flasks and maps. 

The styles were acceptable by military, but not required, and so they were privately sold to anyone, and often incorporated more leisure styles and patterns and prints to appeal to both function and fashion folks

Everyone kept their coats post WWI and so they *really* entered British popularity there. 

by WWII other countries invented their own for their military forces too, but the gist was still very similar. And over time the style just… really has not changed that much as it is so distinctive

Basically: trenches are lightweight and breezy by design and always were intended for oversized layering"
femalefashionadvice,Such a perfect staple! I should look at AllSaints for a leather jacket. I’ve been needing a new one
femalefashionadvice,The pricing can be crazy for sure!
femalefashionadvice,Such a cool and chic jacket!
femalefashionadvice,"my allsaints balfern leather jacket. it dresses up casual outfits, lends an edge to dressy outfits, I wasn’t sure how much wear I’d get out of it living in the rainy PNW but it’s become my go-to going-out jacket. museum date? leather jacket over flowy skirt. upscale dinner? leather jacket and slinky dress. impromptu drinks? leather jacket over my daily leggings and sweater fit. I love that jacket so much"
femalefashionadvice,Those sound pretty
femalefashionadvice,"It’s funny because I get so frustrated with some of their sizing and prices, but then the things I buy from them end up becoming total workhorse pieces in my closet!"
femalefashionadvice,Poncho over coat. It's basically a scarf that got confused.
femalefashionadvice,"For me it's my [Schott Cafe Racer](https://www.schottnyc.com/products/light-cafe-racer-jacket.htm) leather jacket. It's super versatile and instantly makes even super casual outfits look more polished and put together. Works well for spring, fall, and early winter here in the PNW."
femalefashionadvice,Probably either structuring or pins.
femalefashionadvice,My jbrand navy velvet jeans.
femalefashionadvice,"I don't know about where you live, but I see lots of people wearing short dresses with tights in winter. I live in Spain where Zara is from and Spanish people definitely don't go bare legged in winter, yet there are plenty of short dresses and skirts in the winter collections."
femalefashionadvice,I’ve had my eye on that square neck bodysuit!
femalefashionadvice,"I love your comment about blazers, I can relate to that so much. I have a nice Banana Republic one sitting in my closet that I’ve never worn because every time I try I end up looking like a realtor lol. Same with trench coats, I have one as well and never fail to look like a reporter in it. They just look costumey on me, I can’t figure it out!"
femalefashionadvice,That reformation top sounds perfect. I do have a few ref pieces that have become staples
femalefashionadvice,I do appreciate a silk lining. Gorgeous!
femalefashionadvice,"Yes that style in particular is so
Comfortable! I agree"
femalefashionadvice,Can’t go wrong with a Burberry trench and cashmere!
femalefashionadvice,"In between weather, with boots. I live in opaque black tights three seasons a year, but different climates have this middle point where having a little bit of skin out isn't the worst. Where I live there is only a month of ""just wear a caftan, you are doomed to the fire"", but this ambient not to hot, not too cold for a few months on either side of it.

Then again I get compliments on my leg warmers and like tall socks, so our tastes might vary."
femalefashionadvice,It definitely sounds so versatile. Now I need one!
femalefashionadvice,"That does sound like the perfect dress, and I love a flattering waist tie!"
femalefashionadvice,Not me buying this cardigan bc of the link you posted😂 thanks but also I hate you for making me spend $80 on a cardigan hahah
femalefashionadvice,Such a great list. The Mary Janes sound so nice!
femalefashionadvice,"Levi’s Ribcage jeans, the Free People square neck bodysuit, and white AF1 work overtime in my closet."
femalefashionadvice,Could be the white. I wear black tshirts with jeans all the time.
femalefashionadvice,"&gt;It's kind of amazing that we can fit into standard sizing at all given how much we vary. 

Seriously! And wow, jumpsuits are a minefield. I haven't even tried, I suspect it would be a disastrous look even if I found something that fit properly. Good price for hemming, BTW!"
femalefashionadvice,"I have some staple pieces I’ve bought intentionally as a staple piece, but there’s a couple I’ve bought unintentionally which have become so much more important in my closet than the intentional buys. One is a black, long-sleeved, cowl neck top from Reformation that I bought on sale on a whim. Goes with every pair of pants or skirt that I own and can be really dressed up if need be. Another is a Wilson Leather blazer that I thrifted for $15. It’s become my favorite jacket through the fall and our mild winter!"
femalefashionadvice,This is really in the purview of r/ladycyclists and depends on your route and climate but I personally often used to bike with a change in my panniers and change. Shorter midi skirts with bike shorts is do-able although I’d change the bike shorts after.
femalefashionadvice,"I do get bored easily. 

I have a very pared down closet because I live in a small apartment with my favorite essentials plus a few statement items that I wear for a bit and then consign. 

I rent for events, vacations, and to try trends that seem fun but that I’m not sure I’m ready to adopt just yet."
femalefashionadvice,"I've found that packing items that I'm sick of away for a season or two really helps refresh them in my mind - when I'm not looking at them every day, they suddenly feel new again when I see them. I pack away seasonal stuff and things I'm sick of instead of decluttering, just hide some things that I know I loved and wore a lot for a while and it seems to help.  I would suggest doing a similar packing rotation where you live out of little capsules out of your closet that change often. 

I also switch out styles and colours of jewellery, belts, bags, sunglasses (gold, silver, beaded, brass on rotation). Also buying secondhand when boredom strikes, which I'm really trying to do less of. Curious to read about how others deal with this as well - it's just so easy to satisfy the novelty itch by buying stuff, but I often find I end up buying items that are extremely similar to what I already have."
femalefashionadvice,"Not all tights are warm, but fleece lined tights are.  I even layer them under pants in the winter for added warmth"
femalefashionadvice,Are you sizing your shoes properly? They might be big (or the wrong shape for your foot) if your feet have room to slide like that.
femalefashionadvice,You might be into lugsoles? It’s all the height of a heel with all the flatness of flats!
femalefashionadvice,"Ayyy 5’4” club

Yeah I rock em with everything honestly. Flat shoes look more intentional with a slightly shorter hem, pointy toes also work well for flat shoes, but honestly, it’s straight leg jeans, the OG, the other day I didn’t even notice I ran errands in freakin ugg slippers with em, and honestly when I got back after this mortification and looked in the mirror it… still kinda worked lol"
femalefashionadvice,I love Big Bud Press's [baby tees](https://bigbudpress.com/collections/baby-tee)
femalefashionadvice,Bless you for linking because I know I’m gonna just buy anything that’s linked on this thread lol
femalefashionadvice,"Western belts are super trendy right now. Those belts where a snake is the buckle as well. But just a plain circle buckle belt won't look dated or anything. 

Dated would be the double overlapping circle or that Gucci fabric one everyone was wearing like 7 years ago"
femalefashionadvice,"Don't feel dumb, this thread is for getting answers that hadn't occurred to you! I hope you find some awesome stuff. :D"
femalefashionadvice,That’s what I like to do. I usually find a lace bralette that works shape wise with the top or dress and wear that underneath intentionally.
femalefashionadvice,This is absolutely the answer. The same thing happened for me with a pair of overalls.
femalefashionadvice,"Assuming we both think of the classic double-breasted trench with a belt, I think it’s just that many companies are making them waterproof now. When I was looking for one it was rare to see a trench that wasn’t waterproof."
femalefashionadvice,I have the slip-on classic white ones that are made out of cloth (idk if cloth is the right term) but might have to try leather since I have to replace mine at least once a year!
femalefashionadvice,"The Curated [blazer.](https://shopthecurated.net/products/the-classic-blazer?variant=36500664680599&amp;currency=USD&amp;utm_medium=product_sync&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_content=sag_organic&amp;utm_campaign=sag_organic&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiA6fafBhC1ARIsAIJjL8nrYtoL7N1A6qcCpi-LwlV6CbsiEd8bT7cnA_3C4Jhov4jNFk1LD0EaAvNhEALw_wcB). Mildly oversized, but not extreme. And the perfect all weather blazer. A suiting merino wool with a full silk lining. I feel like it’s rare to see the full silk lining now especially at that price. I have other blazers and sometimes I can favor other ones for a moment but this one is my original."
femalefashionadvice,"I was going to say the same! My mom used to harangue me for having visible bra straps when I was younger but nowadays I buy pretty lace bralettes (my favorite are aerie, I'll have to hekc out Cosa!) and let them show intentionally to spice up an open back or an otherwise plain strap :)"
femalefashionadvice,White Nike rosches. They’re my absolute favorite sneakers. I love wearing them with any outfit! So stylish and comfortable too
femalefashionadvice,"Yep. They used to do it with pantyhose, too."
femalefashionadvice,Lol the day I saw the sister wife comment was the day I purchased mine. Sister wives unite!
femalefashionadvice,"Black Burberry Trenchcoat bought 14 years ago. A cashmere scarf as old like the trenchcoat (same brand). 
Grey oversized cashmere sweater. 
White Gucci new ace sneakers (they’re comfy and mine are low key). 
Not necessarily worn at the same time. (But it works 🤣)"
femalefashionadvice,I love the inspiration coming from a novel. That's so fun
femalefashionadvice,"*y e s*

I bought those Babaton suckers as a C cup a couple years ago and after some medical nonsense ya girl is now a DD and the ones I bought back then a: still work, no stretch change nothin and b: still don’t need a freakin bra, hell with the darker colors I don’t even need pasties 

I also, TMI here, can be sweaty and despite frequent af use and not always the most careful wash process, I have no sweat stains on ‘em, no weird seams or pulls, just… damnit I freakin love em"

They don't anything to lift the boobs by themselves, but the friction against the tops or dresses is enough to keep them lifted. Doesn't work as well with flowy items, but it keeps my boobs from looking too torpedo-y. I get the larger size bc my nipples are on the larger size, but this summer I'm considering trying both. If you rinse them off after use, they last many wears."
femalefashionadvice,"I second this. High quality Mid-length black long sleeve dress. You can wear it for work, wedding, funeral, date, graduation, party, etc etc etc. dress up or dress down. Had mine for 8 years now and it’s still my favorite. 

White sneakers, and Doc Martens made in England boots."
femalefashionadvice,Try some Aline or circle skirts.
femalefashionadvice,"Agreed. I don't buy things just because they are on sale, but there are items I need I have my eye on and I do prefer to buy those things when they are on sale."
femalefashionadvice,This is a FANTASTIC post
femalefashionadvice,"To be frank, I’m not a fast walker, and have a short stride, but I’m clumsy and… I’m still pretty useless with big flares. And wide enough leg loose fabrics I have to be careful on stairs 

I think the only answer has to just be structured fabrics and “be careful”? Right?"
femalefashionadvice,"This is how i pair them! Mostly over full sleeve shirts,they give a cute look. I've never worn one without anything under it. It feels like it'll itch."
femalefashionadvice,"Black long-sleeve midi-length shirtdress with waist tie. It's a thick linen blend that gets me through spring, summer, and fall. Looks great by itself on warmer days but also pairs easily with my statement jackets or silk scarves for a more interesting look."
femalefashionadvice,"“If it doesn’t work or make sense to me it’s useless” stuff really is so closed minded! I love that the aim of this is “why do you dig this and how does it work for you in outfits” instead of just saying stuff is dumb

Personally as a sensory issues kid who has always struggled with sleeves, and can only stand to force myself to do them if it’s *very* cold, I love knit tanks of any weave, and love the sweater vest trend because I basically use them as differently structured knit tanks lmao they’re a staple for me. So much so that my husband has a lil commissioned art piece of us and I’m wearing a sweater vest in it lol

I now have lots of arm tattoos so most people no longer question my sleevelessness regardless of weather, and just assume I like to show off lol"
femalefashionadvice,Thanks for the sizing tip!
femalefashionadvice,Any recs for good quality fitted or semi-fitted basic tees? Some that would look good tucked into high-waist jeans but that I can wear untucked too.
femalefashionadvice,"Karate gi set I bought 5 years ago, the pants are worn all year long and they're extremely comfortable. 


Honourable mentions:

Brandy Melville athelia top dupe from AliExpress in pink, white and black. Wear them all year long.

Jonak square toe Mary Jane heels in patent, They're very cute and polished, look lovely with and without socks. 

Fake kanken bag, originally yellow, now dyed light green. Also 5 years old. Will probably upgrade to a larger ""real"" one after it dies, because the inner waterproof coating is peeling (maybe I shouldn't have boiled it)."
femalefashionadvice,Grandmothers really do know what’s up! The coat sounds gorgeous
femalefashionadvice,I’m a big fan of Goodlines!
femalefashionadvice,"Not necessarily a current trend, but bell sleeves and wide flowing sleeves are 100% my aesthetic. They bring me so much joy. But I also cook multiple times per day and many of my hobbies are crafts, so I can't wear them if I want to be functional, and have sadly phased them out of my wardrobe."
femalefashionadvice,"Yeah you need to saturate it with oil. I like baby oil because it’s cheap! I don’t think people understand that you REALLY need to saturate it, not just pour a little bit on. And you sometimes need to let it sit for a few minutes to soak in. Like I’ll stand in my bathtub and make a huge mess to get tape off. Half the oil ends up on the floor of the tub."
femalefashionadvice,I think that’s it. I have narrow feet and always need a heel strap of some kind or else I risk one shoe flying off my foot unexpectedly. Even flip flops are risky!
femalefashionadvice,Tabi is lyfe.
femalefashionadvice,"Ok I really need to scream, please

I put on weight during Covid. I’m at the heaviest I’ve been, and the stereotype of “but I thought I was fat/overweight back then” applies sssooo hard right now

So of course, I’m trying to get back into a healthier life - cooking more at home - better on my wallet and stomach, eating more controlled portions and getting more fruits and veggies in. The usual. And then seeing my trainer - who I know is pushing me and I can feel myself getting stronger. And doing more at home - I bought a rowing machine cos you don’t so much as need to get out of your stinky 2-day old jammies to row in your apt (though - def lucky to hav the space for a rower, no doubt)

And what happens!?? I. Effing. Fall. Sick. 

Monthly, since like - Nov. Whether I can count on my period, the moon, snowfall, the weather, my best friend, the tides or not - I can count on falling sick. Incessant coughing, days off from work then endless playing catch up and worst of all - constant breaks in my workout routine just as I get into the swing of things

AAARRRRGGGGHHHHHHH"

femalefashionadvice,"If anyone out here has more links, I am on the *hunt* for this kind of top! I get so many Pinterest recommendations for beautiful knitting patterns that I'm thinking of learning to knit!"
femalefashionadvice,"similar to u/bubblegumdavid - I go for ones with thicker straps. If I just have to have one with thinner straps, I wear a cute strappy bralette or a strapless bra. I also don't purchase ones with really egregious openwork. It's too hot to wear an extra layer!"
femalefashionadvice,Pencil and draped skirts mostly
femalefashionadvice,"That's pretty much what a puffer costs, actually fairly cheap for a full price one. You may be able to find some good sales on coats in about a month as winter comes to an end. What were you looking to spend and which east coast?

But a decent winter jacket lasts for years, I bought a new winter coat just this year after waearing my previous one for about 14 years."
femalefashionadvice,"Any belt recommendations? I feel like maybe belts are no longer trendy, but I still  need one to keep my jeans up and have no idea what details read stylish instead of dated."
femalefashionadvice,"This has made me go out and buy some straight legged levi jeans, from the charity shop for 4.99, it's strange as it reminds me of the mid 2000's wearing them, maybe I will get to them, but will still wear skinny jeans as that's what the majority of my jeans are."
femalefashionadvice,"I tend to wear bralettes with them so if anything peeks out, it’s cute!"
femalefashionadvice,"Seconding Dr Martens! I have a pair of 1460 boots, and I swear I wear these things everywhere! (Have them on right now)

This is the pair I have:
https://www.drmartens.com/us/en/1460-crazy-horse-leather-lace-up-boots/p/11822203

Keep in mind, depending on the fit and leather, you’ll probably want to size down to allow them to stretch as you break them in"
femalefashionadvice,"That's pretty much what a puffer costs, actually fairly cheap for a full price one. You may be able to find some good sales on coats in about a month as winter comes to an end. What were you looking to spend and which east coast?

But a decent winter jacket lasts for years, I bought a new winter coat just this year after wearing my previous one for about 14 years."
femalefashionadvice,"The second example of your cropped knits (the short vest thing) is somewhat of a wardrobe staple for me. 

I am in Northern Europe so summer here is certainly no Australian summer for example, but I find the evenings can get a little brisk and I love wearing variations on the vest/cropped pullover things over summer dresses. And I LOVE dresses. They are a good 90% of my wardrobe. 

It adds the warmth I need without being too much, is a good size to have in a handbag and (in my opinion) still looks cute over a summer dress."
femalefashionadvice,"I have a coat problem. I have one for every type of weather (11 total).  I  use a lightweight trench when it's 55-60 degrees in spring and all my other fun but not quite warm jackets (faux fur , leather and teddy coats) during the in between seasons time or over a fancy dress if I'm going to an event and will only be outside for a moment. I have 2 puffer jackets.  One can be worn when it's in the negatives, the other up to 30 degrees. Then i have a slightly lighter parka type jacket for 40s. I have 2 rain coats. One is a shell for hot and rainy and one is lined for cold and rainy.  Where I live it goes from -20 one day and 55 the next."
femalefashionadvice,"It’s definitely worth the investment! I’ve been working on transitioning my wardrobe to include more staple pieces too, vs just a lot of fast fashion type clothes. And this is one thing I feel is essential. You can dress it up or down, and if you take care of it (and a good wool coat is pretty solid and can take a lot of wear) it’ll last ages. And a testament to timelessness, my grandmother was actually the one who took me shopping and picked it out. Lady had taste haha"
femalefashionadvice,"I'm 5'0"" so likely too long for me 😅. That's part of my struggle tbh with this style pants. When the fit is right I feel amazing, but if it's off, I feel like they make me look a lot shorter and like I have no waist depending on where they hit. I also like to feel a little snatched and don't know if these would feel that way at all? I am curious about them. Returning Everlane is just kind of a bitch where I live. &gt;_&lt;"
femalefashionadvice,White sneakers always look so classy! Vejas are on my list
femalefashionadvice,"So what I've found, kind of accidentally, is that sizing up fixes the camel toe issue. Source: I bought two jumpsuits when I was a bit plumper and have since lost weight. When I first bought them, they were too short in the torso. Now I am two sizes smaller and they fit perfectly."
femalefashionadvice,"Thanks! Glad we're sharing the denim skirt love, sister wife comments be damned lol. I personally love it with most everything that you would pair normal denim with - turtlenecks, oversized button downs French tucked in, slouchy sweaters, etc! I find it more versatile than I thought tbh"
femalefashionadvice,"I love the look of off-the-shoulder tops and sweaters, and will continue to hold onto the hop that I can find one I like… but I feel like the ones I’ve tried are so annoying! Do people just not move or raise their arms when they wear them? I feel like I have to keep adjusting it every two minutes!"
femalefashionadvice,"I'm loving all of the texture, the pleats (5, 30, 35,) and fringe (3, 7, 44) and ruffles and frills (6,13,19, 26, 31.)  There's something effusive about it I adore, while 27 and 29 hit me in a similar way but are a little more soothing with the colors. The fur and quilted/puffer touches are fun too, but they don't move me in quite the same way.  I'm also enjoying the use of volume- lots of strong shoulders, interesting shapes, and slouchy silhouettes- and bra tops/boudoir dressing (9, 10, 21.)  Monochrome color palettes are always a hit for me and the metallics feel surprisingly modern.  Lastly, I'm very intrigued by the asymmetrical footwear (2, 25) as a styling choice, though I fully expect it's a personal obsession.

I terrible at picking out trends but I think the only ones I'll clearly see irl are the shoe ones, since a pointed toe or knee high boots seem like an easy add.  I'm also finding the high shine metallic/patent leather convincing, though it seems more like an influencer space type of thing. Also, feeling like the pendulum is swinging and neutrals are becoming more blue/grey airy than earthy? Overall great pics, I'm gonna pin a ton of them!"
femalefashionadvice,"if you don't want to you could totally do a longer top or bodysuit, but the halter-ish vibe looks good"
femalefashionadvice,"Sounds basic but definitely my white Nike AF1s and my white Vejas. Got them both years ago and I would say at least half the time I’m wearing one of them. I really need to stop my white sneaker wearing addiction, but they’re just so comfortable and versatile ughhhh"
femalefashionadvice,I used to have huge boobs but I went down 2 cup sizes. i still avoid clothes that didn't agree with my OG boobs. I gotta try tube tops and strapless dresses again and see what happens.
femalefashionadvice,"I retired in 2015.  All my winter shirts, all my workboots, all my flat laceups, all my not-summer tees, predate that and were in use again in their rotation as usual.  I never get bored of anything.  But then I could literally get dressed in the dark and not look any different: top, bottom, shoes, done.  Within their rotation (seasonal), anything is worn with anything."
femalefashionadvice,"How do you dress for winter without going bankrupt?

I'm moving to the east cost soon and I keep hearing I need a long puffy jacket. It seems like everything I find is super expensive though ($200-300). Do you have any recommendations for reasonably priced, good winter jackets? Also any other clothing items I should get for the arctic winter I'm supposedly moving to? How does one dress well in the winter anyway?

Any advice is appreciated!

&amp;#x200B;

Also, the cold weather guide for this subreddit is 7 years old and half of the links no longer work. Maybe it's time for a new one."
femalefashionadvice,That’s incredible you’ve had it for so long. A true testament to how timeless certain pieces are. I’ll keep this in mind for next fall/winter
femalefashionadvice,"also… do people wear underwear underneath them?? If not, do you wash the bodysuit after each wear? Honestly seems really impractical…"
femalefashionadvice,"There's some that open up from the bottom that could work! 
It's just a couple snaps. 
Ita not for everyone, and if poorly made can be uncomfortable or cause other issues. 
But I have one from old navy? I think? That I wear often."
femalefashionadvice,I feel like the knit crop and bralette look is a very summery look when paired with high waist short-shorts and layered with a looser top. The girls on Outer Banks wear a lot of knits for a summer show!
femalefashionadvice,"Any good sales coming up where I could get a discounted GHD flat iron? I don’t follow Ulta, Sephora, etc so idk when the best time to buy one would be. Or if there’s a legit site where they’re discounted that works too, I’m just afraid of ending up with a fake from resale sites."
femalefashionadvice,"I like to buy garments only as I need them - that way they won’t sit forgotten in my closet. 

I’ll use sales to stock up on items I know I love and will wear through, but IME buying something you wouldn’t otherwise just because it’s on sale is a false economy."
femalefashionadvice," I don’t use the snaps, I leave it open and tuck my bodysuit in like a regular top."
femalefashionadvice,"A high quality, minimalistic wool coat. Something more fitted, with clean lines, neutral color, and not too flashy. I personally recommend 3/4 length, because I feel that is flattering on just about everyone. I have black one that I got when I was 16. I’m 35 now, and I still wear it. Never goes out of style"
femalefashionadvice,"Ok so when I pee, I get to the bottom layer and just kinda pull it to the side? Usually the underwear/bodysuit. Same thing if I'm wearing a shorts romper it's just too much hassle otherwise. I imagine it must be what guys feel like when they pee from the opening in boxers (except obviously I clean up after lol)."
femalefashionadvice,They’re so cool! I need a pair
femalefashionadvice,Those sneakers sound so fun! Such a great item because you can use them every day
femalefashionadvice,"r/fragrance is a great resource, but may be overwhelming

A good way to get started it with sample packs. Many brands sell discovery sets, but I’m partial to the mixed-brand sets sold by Sephora and Ulta. They provide an opportunity to try a variety of scents for a few days, and usually include a voucher for a full bottle."
femalefashionadvice,"Don’t you just love a good find like that? I have a few pieces like that as well, and it’s so satisfying. Such random finds that end up being long term staples! That dress sounds fantastic"
femalefashionadvice,I do enjoy a ring stack and the solution is having real gold and silver rather than gold plated so you don’t have to take them off when you wash your hands.
femalefashionadvice,"I’ll check those out, they sound great!"
femalefashionadvice,Dr Martens Jadon platform boots because I'm a basic bitch.
femalefashionadvice,"Silver glitter tabi sneakers.

They wear comfortably and are a surprisingly versatile option, but great in particular for when you're going to be on your feet and still want something eye catching."
femalefashionadvice,"I have mule socks (or half toe socks) that have a grippy bottom. They fit just beyond my toes, so don't show with the shoes, but I don't have to curl my toes with them! I also make sure the fit of the shoe is a little snugger than a shoe with a back, I spray a little bit of anti-perspirant to limit sweatiness, and I don't wear them when I know I have a lot of hustling to do..."
femalefashionadvice,"5'1. Petite jeans, hit just above the ankle bone. With sneakers, low-heeled boots, will do flat sandals in the summer. (Trying to figure out how to wear heels and not hate moving around.)"
femalefashionadvice,\+1 for tucking shirt into underwear haha. Stays in place better than just pants
femalefashionadvice,"I have had this for over a decade so it would be pretty much impossible to link.

I bought a little navy dress at TJ Maxx for like $20.  It had a red belt, which I replaced with a silver one.  Now that is my go to for any occasion I need it for-- job interviews (weather permitting), fundraisers, etc.

I like that it is cap sleeves which means my blazer can stay in the closet for job interviews (I know that was your timeless piece, but I don't feel like myself in blazers-- I feel like a child playing dressup)."
femalefashionadvice,"Uniqlo Heattech tops, which I wear almost every day in winter."
femalefashionadvice,Check out SEE eyewear and mostoc for examples of varied outfits and stylish frames.
femalefashionadvice,"&gt;I tend to buy classic shapes and colours, am afraid of throwing away clothes (because I suddenly fall in love with the same clothes after years), haven't changed significantly in size for 15 years, and tend to buy high quality clothing (which then lasts).

Same here. So I simply don't buy new clothes unless they're replacing something or making a unique contribution. I satisfy my boredom itch with secondhand purchases. If I need to make closet space, they're the first to go. I'm also highly critical about condition - once something no longer looks new or new-ish, out it goes to someone who minds less about these things."
femalefashionadvice,"I feel awkward about this now but I've had one for a few years and I just wear it as I would a cami, but like a bit more dressed up, with a button down shirt/jacket/cardigan over top. Got it before layering like this was as much of a thing. Might adjust for this summer but I think I'll still do both."
femalefashionadvice,"I have a solve for this! I use [these](https://www.aldoshoes.com/ca/en/valva-white/p/12638252?gclsrc=ds&amp;gclsrc=ds) or [these](https://www.aldoshoes.com/ca/en/cockrum-white/p/12640464) in every pair of flats, heels, even some sandals with slippery insoles. 

They go right under the ball of your foot so your toes don't have to do the work to keep the shoes on, also stop your feet slipping around in heels. Totally change the game and can't recommend enough. My doable shoes tripled after I found them!"
femalefashionadvice,"For the most part, pants fit so weird that this doesn’t work with me. The pants will be lower in the back and gap because of my bubble butt, while the front kinda moves around. 


If I’m wearing leggings, this is less of a problem. But I think tucking shirts with leggings looks kinda weird, so I never do it."
femalefashionadvice,So cute! Forgot about Keds. A true classic.
femalefashionadvice,Hmmm!!  Have never thought of a trench coat being waterproof OR having a hood!  Has the definition changed?
femalefashionadvice,Cute outfits while you bike to work? Especially in the summer when it's hot and humid?
femalefashionadvice,"5' club here!  Have never worn heels, can't wear any shoes which don't fasten in some way, so no ballet flats either.  I wear Converse, flat laceups, sports sandals, workboots."
femalefashionadvice,sometimes you can find dresses where the open part is lower on the back. I used to have one when I still presented as female and I was soooo happy i could finally wear something sexy like the small chested girls lol
femalefashionadvice,Non-flats. I love cute shoes but wtf do you do when you want/have to function? I am a pretty active/sprightly/mobile person and find myself frustrated whenever I wear something with a heel. Please help!
femalefashionadvice,Oh interesting! Do you using fingering or sport weight? Any specific yarn recommendations?
femalefashionadvice,How did that never occur to me? I feel dumb
femalefashionadvice,White leather Keds. They are extremely comfortable and versatile.
femalefashionadvice,People dressed that way always look like they're about to get casual-but-coordinated family pictures taken.
femalefashionadvice,Can you share the videos you watched please? I’ve tried and still can’t get the gals to stay up lol.
femalefashionadvice,"I struggle with this as well, and it's pretty hard to find loose leg fits. My current shorts I found on clearance at Kohl's and never found any more, sob."
femalefashionadvice,"Sounds like you need a tall size anyway, and hem if necessary. Similar with one-piece swim suits. (Though I'm tall and I confess I don't bother with jumpsuits. I feel your pain!)"
femalefashionadvice,"Keep an eye on AE as well. They tend to have a variety of styles once you get past the jeggings, and most styles come in 3 or 5 (!) lengths which affect the rise, not just leg length. They've had different styles of straights and slim straights, plus slim bootcuts that I'm really loving. I have heavy thighs and hips and skinny calves, and more than 10"" waist/hip difference. (Always get the waist tailored.) Keep trying, and turn over different retail leaves. You never know what you'll find."
femalefashionadvice,"Yup, bodies are weird!  I'm 5', I have a pair of men's trousers which I only have to turn up a little on the outside (I don't shorten anything).  Now back in the the 1970's, yup I was the girl with the 6"" hems, because trousers were LOOOOONG to be worn with heels, which I didn't."
femalefashionadvice,Ha I have the wide flat feet mentioned.  Also maybe gross but my feet sweat so probably natures double sided tape.  😂
femalefashionadvice,"Me too Hedgehog! My feet swell
up and are super wide. Mules are like the only cute shoe I can tolerate"
femalefashionadvice,"Yeesh, I really am not a fan of any of these. It honestly looks like toddlers dressed most of them 😬"
femalefashionadvice,cropped hoodies? I just don’t get them. I have a few but I don’t get to wear them cuz if I’m cold why would I wanna expose my stomach?
femalefashionadvice,"Personally, if I really want a piece, I will pay full price for it as soon as I see it to secure it, though this doesn't happen very often. If you know what you want and want to save a little, then shortly after launch many retailers offer 10-20% discounts - you will find 95% of the launch stock is included. A lot of stuff never makes it to the June sales, though obviously you can get much bigger discounts if you gamble on your pieces still being in stock by this time."
femalefashionadvice,"That makes sense! I live in the south, so definitely opposite climates"
femalefashionadvice,That one is great! And yes - I think my biggest confusion around trench coats is that many of them are waterproof but don’t have a hood…? Maybe I am just not committed enough to fashion to carry around an umbrella lol
femalefashionadvice,I find the trick where you saturate it with oil works pretty well.
femalefashionadvice,That makes sense!
femalefashionadvice,"Totally agree - I live in the south and a lightweight raincoat is a must. Typically I don’t see trenches with hoods, and I definitely prefer to have my raincoat with one because I definitely lose all of my umbrellas lol"
femalefashionadvice,"Only way they’d work with BF is if they have a neckline wide enough to pop one boob right out of them. And even then, it would only work assuming the fabric doesn’t pinch and just stays put."
femalefashionadvice,when I was dating my now husband he referred to them as “cavewoman” tops and I can’t unsee it now -20 years later!
femalefashionadvice,The wacoal bra is amazing! I have two bc I wear I so much in spring/summer.
femalefashionadvice,"That is good to know! It's kind of amazing that we can fit into standard sizing at all given how much we vary. And your description of waist and rise is reminding me of trying on jumpsuits and how the crotch is always in a different place, lordy.

Luckily hemming pants only runs me $13 at the tailor."
femalefashionadvice,"Hello! Have you checked out our [Guide to Not Freezing to Death](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/3sf5f8/the_beginners_guide_to_not_freezing_to_death/)? Have you searched the subreddit for ""layers"", ""cold"", or ""winter""?

femalefashionadvice,"I just grabbed my pair to put on to see if I could answer your q since I don’t ever have to think about how I walk.

To be fair, They’re knockoff Gucci Princetowns so more of a slide but still. They’re also leather. The vamp goes all the way up to my tarsals and the tongue covers the inflection point of the top of my foot above the high point of my arch.

Additionally the vamp extends along the sides in a diagonal line towards the heel (talking about this

https://preview.redd.it/mk1fryxgw0la1.jpeg?width=1125&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=58a8e1657af4c18b5b30dae5bb42f2ce14c85e9d

)

I think these elements + leather instead of synthetic keep it quite fitted to my foot. If my foot gets too warm then yes I’ll get some sweat and be more likely to slip out or blister, but I don’t typically wear these in warmer weather."
femalefashionadvice,"yes I hate it too and also I keep on seeing these cardigans in tacky colors which doesn’t help. it’s a definite NO
from me!"
femalefashionadvice,"I have a huge fragrance collection, amassed over many years. I like everything I own. But just like clothes, some fragrances are better suited for certain moods or occasions or seasons than others. So I think the first thing you need to know is that you don't need to have a 'signature' fragrance. This is just a marketing tool to encourage brand loyalty. You can like and wear as many fragrances as you like.

I think the first thing to do is to establish what fragrance notes you like and dislike. Go into a Sephora or similar and try lots of very different fragrances on paper to see whether you prefer citrus, floral, woody, green, etc fragrances. Wear a scarf and inhale into it when your nose feels tired. Do not sniff coffee beans in between tests, as is often recommended, as it overwhelms your sense of smell.

Once you have established which style of fragrance you prefer, you can try different brands within the same 'family'. You may need to spread this over several visits. A shortcut, if you don't mind spending, is to purchase sample sizes - Zara make high quality fragrances that are suitable for this purpose.

I wouldn't do the skin test until you're fairly confident you've found a fragrance you like. It is really only done to check that the fragrances combines well with your skin chemistry and lasts as long as you want."
femalefashionadvice,These crop tops.  Just NO
femalefashionadvice,"I use KT tape. I'll put a square of toilet paper or Kleenex over the nipple to help with removal, but it usually isn't bad."
femalefashionadvice,"I keep seeing these on Instagram
and wasn’t sure if they were for real! Will give them a try, thanks!"
femalefashionadvice,"That's awesome, thanks for the rec!"
femalefashionadvice,"A a few years ago I discovered pretty lace bralettes (my favorite are from Cosabella) and unless
it’s for a fancy occasion, it looks super cute to show a bralette intentionally!"
femalefashionadvice,"Hmm. The torso has 2 elements: waist and rise. Waist is waist to shoulder, rise is waist to crotch. I have a short waist and a very long rise, so overall a slightly long torso. Petite tops tend to fit well (w/o long sleeves) and I always need at least Long pants, but not super long. At AE I usually buy XLong so I can get the extra rise length and then hem because I don't need the extra 1-2"" in the leg.

Bodies are so not standard!"
femalefashionadvice,Yesss. The outfit she’s wearing when she gets the iconic “virgin who can’t drive” burn is my favorite outfit in the movie.
femalefashionadvice,"Not sure this helps with your precise issues here, but do check out American Tall for non-pants clothing. I've bought for my father (6'8"" and relatively skinny) - so many Big and Tall places are more on the Big and less on the (extra) Tall. I am your height and fine with AE jeans myself (I buy XLong for the rise height and usually hem) but mini dresses are a joke for sure! I've been very impressed with the American Tall quality and mission, however."
femalefashionadvice,"I am pear-shaped and I feel you! As per other items in my wardrobe that are one piece but fit me it's been about trial and error and looking for cuts and random elements that will work to my figure. 

I have a jumpsuit that I love which has wider legs so it sits on my hips and legs nicely plus a zip at the back but ALSO has a tie back on the top half which means it doesn't just sit loosely on my chest."
femalefashionadvice,"Oversized jeans or blazers when you are petite!

I'm 5 feet tall and 100lbs. All the current fashion drowns me and makes me look even shorter!"
femalefashionadvice,I can wear flat mules but not sling-backs. I think my feet may just be weird.
femalefashionadvice,"I do get bored of certain looks after a while, so I try my best to not spend a lot of trendy items. I’ll allow a few per season, but other than that, my purchases are mostly classics."
femalefashionadvice,"I find I don’t need hemming from Everlane, Cos, &amp; Other Stories and brands like that. If it’s wide leg super long pants, I do, but I think it’s usually because they’re designed to puddle and be hemmed to your length because full length varies so much more than a crop."
femalefashionadvice,"Rings usually get snagged when a stone is loose and if they're reeeaallly cheap that part will be super flimsy so shouldn't be a big problem. You could experiment with plain rings which have no gems to start with. I feel you on the hand washing though, I have worn them on occasion taken them off to wash my hands and then forgotten to put them back on. I think the solution is to buy real gold or a less reactive metal like stainless steel that won't get ruined by washing your hands with it on."
femalefashionadvice,"No solution, but TBH knits are going to be worse in this regard. They wrap around and catch easier and if you step on them they stretch and hold instead of jerking free. Jeans would be safer."
femalefashionadvice,I saw hers! With the slit. Really cool. I got a black one as well but mine has the slit in the back.
femalefashionadvice,I get cold on top so long sleeves and short skirt works just fine. But one sleeve just won't do it!
femalefashionadvice,"Yeah, I feel coldest on my arms so often end up with a light cardigan on top of a summer dress, especially if there's aircon or a breeze. 

Long sleeves save me on so many occasions, especially nights out where you might be in a warm bar or restaurant but it's a bit chilly outside and you don't want to wear an extra layer.

But also echoing thoughts that maybe this is an early Spring or late Autumn where tights are an option."
femalefashionadvice,"Okay, so while I don't have a clear aesthetic I have a somewhat consistent personal style.  My choices are somewhat eclectic but I've actually managed to shrink my wardrobe considerably the past few years while keeping a lot of variety.

Primarily, I'd think it helps to build a realistic view of how you use your closet.  While I don't have a capsule wardrobe, I've found that capsule wardrobe content is useful in that it allows you to see how much you can do with fairly little.  There's a focus on how you use things that can be a great way to approach organizing your closet to get a clear picture of what you have, and where you might have too much.  When I'm looking at similar items, I'll usually ask myself how often I'll want to wear it between washes.  For me, that's every 2 weeks, and I like to change things up, so for something like a black turtleneck, I wouldn't want more than 4 because I don't want to wear that more than twice a week.  I'm sure it'll look different for you, but the idea is to give yourself space to change things up so they don't get monotonous.  Try and have enough visual difference between similar things that while they serve might the same purpose, they're in some way distinctly different so while you're building the same outfit, it's not necessarily the same outfit.

As for what to keep/buy, I'd say work on building stricter requirements that aren't based entirely on visuals.  My current ones are things like color, fabric content, and versatility; even if I love something, if the color doesn't play well with others, it doesn't do much (i.e. shirts that can't stand alone and *have* to be layered,) or the care is fussy, I'm willing to let it go.  While I don't always do it, it also makes something like 1 in, 1 out easier.  Occasionally, I'll have a placeholder item, where I know what I want it to do but it does it poorly, and I'll make note of it so I don't end up with multiple items trying to do the same thing (right now, it's a fleece blazer that's patterned and the perfect weight, just too bright.)  Focusing on things mesh well instead of just being similar is great for longevity as well, because you can change up the styling or your go-to combos from year to year, depending on what's trending or how you feel.  Lists can also be helpful in being more conscious of what you buy: I keep a few, but the ones that have been most useful for moderation are the one that outlines my purchases for the year that I rate at it's end (the good, the bad, the unnecessary) as well as the one of things I shouldn't be buying because the section is 'full.'

Anyways, hope at least some of this was helpful and best of luck!"
femalefashionadvice,"I don’t wear the exact same things in my late 30s as I did in high school, but there’s continuity. It’s always mostly black, with some gray, olive, denim. White in the summer. I’ve never not had a pair of chucks. Although silhouettes have come and gone, I think my style aesthetic had stayed mostly the same. There was a period in my 20s when I tried to dress more “normal” — colors, j crew, prints — but it never felt like me. Now 80% of my wardrobe is black, like it was in HS, and I don’t have any desire for it to change."
femalefashionadvice,"Jump suits and rompers. Taking off my top section, exposing my boobs or bra in a piblic toilet is what stopped me from buying them. And they are so fun and usually look so cool. But I hate the feeling. I wore one to a workshop and  went to the loo maybe 3 times over the course of the day and I hand to constantly take down the top half and sit in my bra on the toilet at the conference facility. I hated every second of it."
femalefashionadvice,"If the sleeves are made of a lighter contrasting material like tulle, I imagine they’d be a bit cooler"

femalefashionadvice,"Bathing suits I've had less issue with (maybe because they're supposed to be super tight?). Racing/Swim Team suits come in different lengths, usually in inches, so maybe see if you can find one in a sportco or something that fits and then compare lengths online?"
femalefashionadvice,I think I do! Never actually bothered to measure it all out but based on my fit struggles that’s what my assumption was lol
femalefashionadvice,"This would probably only work on knits, but I tuck the ruffles into the sleeves when I need to wash my hands. I have one dress and the wrist ruffles are about 3"" long.

In full disclosure, I got the idea from 18th century novels talking about men taking off coats and waistcoats and ""tucking up their ruffles"" in order to duel. I tried it and it works super well!"
femalefashionadvice,I wear mine with crop tops to break up the silhouette or just cuff ‘em and pair with chunky boots
femalefashionadvice,Two layers of tights can be *very* warm
femalefashionadvice,"yea, it really shouldn’t have to be this difficult, it’s ridiculous that we have to put this much time and effort into something that any one of the million companies making fleece tights could fix easily :/"
femalefashionadvice,"All I can say is rings don't bug me, but I've given up on the bangles that I used to wear in college. So annoying!"
femalefashionadvice,What boob-tape do you use? I haven't found any that works for me.
femalefashionadvice,"Same here! Jumpsuits/rompers are way more me than a dress but it’s so hard to find them! Some of the shorter ones that I have I just pull to the side so the seam isn’t dead center on me and can get and extra inch of fabric but sometimes there’s nothing I can do🙄 I’ve heard that Old Navy sells some “tall” rompers that I’m hopefully could help the issue but I’ve never tried them

Following this and hoping others have tips/brands

On a similar note, I’d like to buy a one-piece bathing suit and there are so many cute ones online but I’m worried I’ll have the same issue there"
femalefashionadvice,"https://preview.redd.it/h2ti5ahhr0la1.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=a776088c35a372a31d28afe346a6fef61a93d429

I tried adding a link but it was deleted because it’s from Amazon I guess. But this is the idea, they’re pretty inexpensive"
femalefashionadvice,I don't have a long torso. So that's weird! Would you say you have a short torso?
femalefashionadvice,"Well, there are fewer “Burn it all! Shouldn’t be made! No one can wear that!” comments than usual so that’s a plus."
femalefashionadvice,Calling u/black_bir although I think hers is technically more of a midi
femalefashionadvice,Try sizing down! I get a little more support when I do
femalefashionadvice,"I mean, white in general doesn't look great on some people. Have you tried a different neutral colour?"
femalefashionadvice,"Curvy fits, American Eagle carries then in shorts styles and Abercrombie/Hollister will closer to summer if they dont at the moment. Madewell probably does too but idk if they have fitted versions, ive never bought from them tbh."
femalefashionadvice,"Lol SAAAME. Mules are so so cute but I cannot make it more than a few feet. I’ve found a few pairs of leather loafers that fit well and don’t give me blisters, but mules are a mystery. Are they just for show??"
femalefashionadvice,"I looooove short dresses with long sleeves! I think it’s kind of unexpected to wear sleeved dresses, but just for my body type I like being covered up on top but still having some leg out. Cute with tights too"
femalefashionadvice,I feel like they're dressing more for the fashion week concept itself than specifically bc its London. The level of wackiness is quite similar to every other fashion album OP has done.
femalefashionadvice,"Wow, that's blowing my mind. Is there somewhere you get most of your pants?

The mystery deepens because my proportions are pretty even. I don't have a long torso. A lot of my shorter friends are taller than me when we're sitting down, lol. And yet I've had to get pants hemmed from a huge list of brands! The only brand I can think of where the length fits every time is American Eagle."
femalefashionadvice,"You are (fashion) god's favorite today, congrats! I love it when this happens lol"
femalefashionadvice,Do you have a link to something like this? I'm struggling to understand what you mean by around the belly.
femalefashionadvice,In the world of boob tape I think a strip of double-sided in your shoes is well within some people's boundaries
femalefashionadvice,"I actually do have nippies! They don’t show an outline which is great, although because they cover a larger area (I’m a 36D), they end up having a similar effect to sticky bras where they give me major underboob sweat.

I’ll have to check out Klassy Network! I see their ads all the time"
femalefashionadvice,"I live in northern Canada, so definitely not a moderate climate, and these are summer jackets for me. For most of spring, summer, and fall it's too cold to go without a jacket entirely, but also too warm for wool or down, so I have summer jackets (things like leather jackets, soft shells, or bomber jackets) and summer sweaters (loose knit cotton) for those seasons."
femalefashionadvice,"I love the color family looks, lots of blues and reds for em, quite a bit of purples, and less greens than the last couple years. Love that hug me jacket and the heart puffer, especially since some of the outerwear items seem even less practical than other FW’s seem to have had (though maybe that’s a bias since I’ve just seen this one most recently so it’s fresher, regardless: I love a cute functional coat)

I absolutely hate that ear purse that is most unsettling to me, if I saw someone out at a restaurant with it I would be completely unable to look away for long out of sheer distress lmao"
femalefashionadvice,"Based on your description it might be worth trying a different brand, but I’d probably test on a different area of your skin. I’ve never worn boob tape personally, but I use athletic tape a lot on one of my knees and some brands are absolutely horrible to remove from the skin (even after days of wear) because the adhesive is just too strong. It’s a fine balance between adhering to the skin for the needed duration vs needing to be able to safely remove from the skin… and I don’t really see any reason why the adhesive would need to be more aggressive for boob tape (I’d even wager that KT tape would do a decent job - I can usually remove it cleanly in less than a day if needed). 

The only other advice I have on removal is to go slow - and to hold the skin relatively taut by pulling on it in the opposite direction of how you’re removing the tape. This helps avoid extreme pulling of the skin/causing damage."
femalefashionadvice,"I can wear flat mules just fine. It does require scrunching the toes a bit. I also have some mules with a heel, and those are a bitch to walk in. I have to scrunch my toes harder and take small steps. I only wear them to occasions where I know I’ll be doing more sitting."
femalefashionadvice,"If you’ve got small/medium boobs, go braless baby!! I neverrrr wear a bra with my bodysuits. Looks so much better without all the lumps and bumps and straps underneath. Most of my bodysuits aren’t work appropriate anyway, so I’m wearing them out on the town and I’m not worried about nipping out. I do the same with dresses and thin-strap tops. Going braless changed my life! 

If you have big boobs and need the support, that’s a much tougher problem…"
femalefashionadvice,"But this doesn't sound like a fashion forward thing, and these dresses are regularly sold at Zara and such. I really doubt Zara designers keep fleece lined tights in mind constructing their dresses :)"
femalefashionadvice,"I go braless or wear reusable silicone pasties if I don't want to be nipply. My boobs are A cups though, I don't know what bigger breasted people do."
femalefashionadvice,I had more success with bodysuits when I sized up and bought tall sizes.
femalefashionadvice,"Short shorts, as someone with thick thighs. The pant area always rides up my thighs so much and I get crotch wedgies all day! I aim for looser fits to help with this, but fitted ones always suck. I guess maybe I have to find a brand with a better waist-to-hip ratio for my body shape?"
femalefashionadvice,"This post has useful information, but I am so sick of all the snark being directed at ""old"" trends. Like, what if people took a positive tone instead of insulting half of people's wardrobes?"
femalefashionadvice,"Thanks! The model is showing midriff, I was worried that might be too casual? But I'll do some searches for something similar!"
femalefashionadvice,"About a year ago I was shopping for a wedding guest dress and came across a J Crew dress that I thought was absolutely gorgeous but it was $300-$400, maybe more like $250 when a good sale came around, and I just couldn't justify it. 

Today I was randomly reminded of it and went looking. It's gone from the website, of course, but I managed to track it down with some strategic google image searches. Lo and behold, I found it listed NWOT for a fraction of the original price on Poshmark. The seller just accepted my offer and [this pretty lady](https://www.jcrew.com/s7-img-facade/BK819_PT2208) is soon to be mine. 

Is it the most practical purchase for my lifestyle? No. Am I working my way towards my fantasy White Lotus wardrobe? You betcha."
femalefashionadvice,"Yes to this question! I can’t wear shoes without backs because they fall off. Or I need to constantly curl my toes up, which makes my feet sore in such a strange way."
femalefashionadvice,"I hesitate to recommend this brand, because unless you're very short and very pale, the one size/color probably won't work. But on the off chance you're pasty white and 5'2"" like me, Arrusa winter thermal tights on Amazon are nothing short of magic for $15.

I did just find that Cozy Crew has them in more skin tones and sizes for only $30, which seems pretty reaosnable for such a wardrobe staple!"
femalefashionadvice,"I have yet to find a jumpsuit or romper that doesn't give me massive camel toe.  Surely there are other long-torsoed women out there, do you all also not bother with jumpsuits? I'm not tall, but all my height is in my torso. I can't wear petites because the crotch is too short, but regular pants are too long. 

Relatedly, how do you find a jumpsuit that you can actually take on and off to pee?"
femalefashionadvice,I find this video helpful! https://www.instagram.com/reel/CnioPWpNj5B/?igshid=MWMzM2Q4ZmE=
femalefashionadvice,"Damn, that sucks, I had good luck with one of their bodysuits. Damn pup ate the crotch out of it though so that sucked lol

Buzzoms I haven’t tried yet, but have heard recent good things?"
femalefashionadvice,Mango pop on Amazon. I’ve bought a few colors in the long sleeve crewneck and I’ve liked them a lot. The white is decently opaque but black is my staple
femalefashionadvice,"Rings! I love the way a bunch of chunky stacked rings look but it seems impractical for hand-washing, I'm afraid they'll get snagged on things, etc. Do you just get used to it? 

Also this is such a great thread idea and I'm sad to see the comments devolving into the usual general complaints about fashion and how [perfectly normal body variation X] means that you can't wear [fashion item Y]."
femalefashionadvice,"Sticky bras! There aren't many in larger sizes, but I find that even something that doesn't fit properly (leaves boob around the edges) keeps things contained and is much easier than boob tape."
femalefashionadvice,"I just … I just don’t understand how folks wear body suits, like the kind with a brief or thong bottom. 

I know they’re popular, I want to like them, I just…. can’t. 

Like… okay, the snaps. How do you deal with them bunching up against your vulva?  What if they unsnap when you’re just out in the world, waking around, in a meeting?

But if there are no snaps, then how do you pee? Do you pull the bottom to the side? Do you get naked? 

If there are no snaps, do you wear panty liners? But then that gets bunched up because of the wedgies?

My god, the wedgies!!!! Every time I wear one, I feel like I have to pull it out every three steps. Why do they try to cut me in half?! My ass is NOT that hungry! 😅😂"
femalefashionadvice,"I would honestly wear those crop/tank knits in the summer (except that weird ""crop tank"" sweater vest one - that looks like it should go over the top of a longer white button-down). Like... 75-85 degrees (f) would probably be fine to wear them alone. Otherwise, under a cardigan or jacket for anything cooler."
femalefashionadvice,"When I got married in 2018, my then-fiance (who never cared much about clothes) unilaterally decided to order a CREAM suit and would NOT be talked out of it when I found out. I was worried it would clash with my white dress and yep, it kind of did! Now we're about to have our 5th anniversary and I'm still salty about it tbh. So I think it's a good thing you are going with him. 😂"
femalefashionadvice,This outfit sounds so cute! i like how you made the short boots work by using longer socks. I'm going to have to try that!
femalefashionadvice,"The suggestions are great. I just can’t help resenting the fact that, once again, women of color are excluded from products that represent us and that we have to spend extra time and money researching and buying more products to compensate."
femalefashionadvice,Is there a beginner's guide to buying perfume? I'd like something for occasional wear but when I go into the perfume section I smell one or two and start feeling overwhelmed and nose blind. And then there's the question of how different a perfume will smell on my skin vs on the little test papers. So what's the best approach? Should I just test a bunch of options over the course of a month to avoid getting overwhelmed?
femalefashionadvice,"My first thought with many of these looks was 'London? In February? I bet they're freezing'. Looking at you 2, 5, 10, 13, 17, 18, 19, and more. 

Some great colour combinations though! Love the blue denim with teal coat in 24. The green hearts with those pink trousers &amp; boots in 1 is very Alice in Wonderland. The black with orange and brown tones in 4 is great. And everything about 9 is wonderful."
femalefashionadvice,"This isn't a style question, but when do you think is a good time to start buying summer clothing?

I tend to buy fewer, more expensive pieces and I sometimes I feel like I jump the gun and miss out on big sales."
femalefashionadvice,"This is the way. 

I wear long sleeves during most of the year because it’s hot and the horrible daystar burns me. Lightweight fabric with a lot of coverage keeps me from overheating."
femalefashionadvice,"Where the fuck can I find some minimalist, waist-accented spaghetti strap midi dresses?

I want to incorporate more dresses into my wardrobe this spring and have been looking everywhere with no luck. Everything is either ditzy florals and puff sleeves or corporate-y wrap dresses.

[This](https://www.madewell.com/reistor-sunbeam-sundays-dress-N4221.html?dwvar_N4221_color=WC6066&amp;cgid=apparel-dress-midi#start=134) and [this](https://www.urbanoutfitters.com/shop/motel-padil-satin-midi-dress?category=midi-maxi-dresses&amp;color=017&amp;type=REGULAR&amp;quantity=1) are very close to what I’m looking for but the fabric and/or pattern aren’t my style. So far I’ve looked at: Madewell, Everlane, Urban Outfitters, Anthropologie, Quince, Boden, Uniqlo, I’m sure I’m forgetting a few."
femalefashionadvice,What industry are you in?
femalefashionadvice,"They're not leggings, but I really like the women's [contour curvy high-rise](https://www.target.com/p/women-39-s-contour-curvy-high-rise-straight-leg-pants-with-power-waist-31-5-34-all-in-motion-8482-black-xl/-/A-77357471?preselect=77357471#lnk=sametab) pants from Target. The pockets are a great size."
femalefashionadvice,Burning Man or other festivals. I have seen and worn similar style tops in those settings.
femalefashionadvice,"Actually the opposite is making a comeback. Recent trends have skewed towards pleated trousers again and so, by design, high rise trousers are back. If you can afford it, I'd at least make the transition to custom or, at the least, made to measure. That way, doesn't matter what the trend is, you can always buy trousers exactly how you like them."
femalefashionadvice,"Yes, over the years this has bothered me as well. When I was in my early 20's and just getting into menswear I adorned the look, thinking it made me appear fashion forward and stylish. As I've aged (approaching 37 in late March), I've noticed I have an adverse reaction to the look and prefer my trousers tailored to just kiss the top of my shoe or be ever so slightly above it (in the case of loafers only) with a cuff. What I can't stand the most is the cropped suit trousers without socks. Especially on a suit that isn't a casual suit (eg: worsted wools, sharkskins, high twist wools, etc.), it throws the entire outfit off and makes the wearer appear that they clearly don't know what they are doing and don't have enough knowledge of menswear to understand that its not a suitable style option."
femalefashionadvice,"Idk they just work fine? 

It works much better with a molded footbed, like a birkenstock or similar material, rather than a slick or shiny footbed. As soon as u start sweating the shiny footbeds are slip city but they are ok on cooler days. They are basically the same as slides?"
femalefashionadvice,"Try the Suki or Elise jeans from Silver Jeans. They do have elastane but aren't clingy. I also like their ""slim bootcut"" styles, and they have mid rises."
femalefashionadvice,"Every spring for like the last 40 years, there’s and article about how timeless and classic and universally flattering the white tshirt and jeans combo is. It never looks good on me. Never. No matter the type of white t- tissue/boxy/fitted or the style of jeans - straight/ skinny/flare. 
Just like so many other things, it only looks good photo shopped on a model."
femalefashionadvice,"I live in the US mid-Atlantic and my trench coat has already seen a lot of use in this milder-than-normal winter. I’ve worn it over everything from a thin turtleneck to a wool sweater and it’s been great. It also really pulls my look together and looks super polished.

It was very hard to find one that was waterproof that also had a hood though (which IMO is so stupid - why WOULDN’T I want a hood?). I bought [this one.](https://www.marksandspencer.com/us/pure-cotton-stormwear%E2%84%A2-longline-trench-coat/p/000000060563378005.html?ef_id=Y-5D7wAABbCqQjIX%3A20230228181159%3As&amp;extid=ps_ggl_US_All_SmartShopping_Womenswear_-&amp;gbraid=0AAAAAD7g6bRTOGdIVfG_4Y0_7XOB3eC6w&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiA6fafBhC1ARIsAIJjL8nlpunVY0kjVOZXXBiqFU6vsihd31l-8c2coAPjFTrovmfUfweRnwwaAllTEALw_wcB&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds)"
femalefashionadvice,A couple of those are knit in cotton too! It looks thick and wooly but probably actually quite breathable and not too warm.
femalefashionadvice,"Same. Am currently wearing a plaid mini skirt with tights, and a long sleeved cashmere sweater. 

Mini skirts without tights feels way too exposed!"
femalefashionadvice,I’ve liked H&amp;M and Zara kids clothes!
femalefashionadvice,"For lightweight trenches - I don’t wear mine for the rain. I use it when there’s a breeze or a bit of wind but it’s otherwise fairly nice out. The synthetic material and tight weave hold the wind, so a sweater underneath is usually enough to be warm"
femalefashionadvice,"I was in Madrid in November and they were ubiquitous. They’re useful in places where winter = 40F and you need to walk a lot while looking slightly more formal. People don’t really do hoods and prefer umbrellas. Can’t pop the collar Burberry style with a hood. 

Absolutely useless in New Hampshire though, sadly."
femalefashionadvice,This is extremely relevant to me right now because I just ordered a pair (they were so cute!!!) and I'm worried about them making that loud CLACKING sound as I walk. Will I just need to shuffle from place to place?
femalefashionadvice,"Spinal cord issue/nerve damage, and same. I can only wear slip-ons that have a toe post/flip flops."
femalefashionadvice,"I ordered a top from Klassy in two different sizes (one smaller, one true to size) and the built-in “bra” is a joke. Think of the least supportive sleep bra you can buy and then put foam cups in it. Absolutely no support, I do it recommend."
femalefashionadvice,I hate them.
femalefashionadvice,I like to see something new and then endlessly put together outfits with it + my existing clothes. It does lead to shopping but the practice means I don’t haphazardly add new things
femalefashionadvice,Old navy has linen blend rompers that have more Booty space. They are tighter on top which means I can get away with going braless if I wear a scarf.
femalefashionadvice,"I had a top made (I think it's called a Choli) like the pictured one. They make it explicitly to fit around your bra, and they can even put in little straps to snap around your bra strap to keep it up. Never had a garment fit so well."
femalefashionadvice,"Any recommendations for curvy workout pants in the plus size (16) range?

Anything I get that fits my tights/hips is waaaaay too loose around the waist and keeps falling down. I got some pants with a tie strap but don't love the feeling while being active.

Thanks!"
femalefashionadvice,"Just a thought, I’m also 5’9 but can never find pants long enough and don’t really have a problem with mini dresses. Let’s for days but bum is covered. I just assumed I had a short torso and most of my height is in my legs. Maybe you have a long torso? My mom does and always struggled to find tops that don’t ride up too."
femalefashionadvice,That sounds so cute!!!
femalefashionadvice,"Awesome questions. I’m interested to hear others takes on this! 

I’m in my 20s so I have definitely noticed my style/aesthetic change over the years. I think it’s normal—the clothes I wore in high school and even college aren’t aligned with my lifestyle now. 

I’d love to hear what others think, especially older individuals who have been at it for longer"
femalefashionadvice,Would love to see how people are/will be styling full length trouser or denim skirts. I think it’s a cool look with a basic tank or tee but would love some more ideas.
femalefashionadvice,"Oh dear. So many visitors who think they have to dress wacky 'because it's London'.  The actual trends in there are all-black (#21, #48 and more), wide top and bottom together (#16), Adidas three stripe (#20), 80s square shoulders and knee length (#28), and flared denim maxis (#34) - a shift from the current oversized-straight trend. I think the red trend was more evident in the shows than on the street, but it's already evident in the spread of red opaque tights."
femalefashionadvice,Big fan of silver boots/shoes overall right now! Great picks.
femalefashionadvice,"Since you’re petite, have you tried any regular sized blazers to see if you can get that long but less baggy look?"
femalefashionadvice,"Bodysuits. Love the idea, can't square them with breastfeeding. They're so cute though!"
femalefashionadvice,Another vote for [fisherman sandals](https://www.harpersbazaar.com/fashion/trends/g40108770/best-fisherman-sandals/). And they can be dressed up or down [link](https://www.whowhatwear.com/fisherman-sandal-outfits).
femalefashionadvice,"Is it possible you have a long torso to leg ratio? It seems possible given your two complaints. I’m 5’4” with pretty even proportions and don’t have to get too many pairs of pants hemmed, and if I do, I tend to only take off an inch."
femalefashionadvice,"I’ve used Brassybra boob tape before and had great results. It’s teardrop-shaped instead of in a roll, and you can cut the tape once it’s “cured” on your skin to fit the cut of your top. There’s a little bit of a learning curve, but I guess that’s boob tape in general."
femalefashionadvice,Second the recommendation for Nippies/B6 covers. Ive used the same pair on a weekly basis for over a year now.
femalefashionadvice,"I have a few square neck bodysuits from Aritzia [(like this one)](https://www.aritzia.com/en/product/contour-squareneck-longsleeve-bodysuit/73936002.html?gclid=EAIaIQobChMI2Njtx-S4_QIVcPDjBx2UcQ_VEAQYASABEgLHMPD_BwE) that I ADORE and they’re supportive enough that I can comfortably get away without a bra at all, and I’m a 36DDD. They’re honestly great quality for the money and they come in all different styles but made from the same stretchy/supportive material! Would absolutely recommend"
femalefashionadvice,"For the latter, having a coat with a more oversized cut solves the bunching in the armpits. It makes a coat more versatile than a close classic cut. It can still be a classic shape and fitted in the shoulders, but you just need a wider sleeve in the underarm or throughout."
femalefashionadvice,"Agree with this. I'm 5'4"" and prefer my straight jeans cropped to about two inches above my ankle or they look terrible on me. Thankful that unfinished hems are popular right now so I can trim them to the right inseam length.   


Wide leg, however, looks much better full length on my frame, though I do enjoy those at a cropped length too."
femalefashionadvice,I think they’re fine in the cold. It’s about the layering underneath. Sometimes you have a warm enough knit or layers and the only thing you need is a wind proof or water resistant layer. That’s where the nylon thin trench comes in.
femalefashionadvice,"I just assumed this was a layering piece and the model didn't have a shirt under so that we'd know the item being advertised was the cardigan. I guess I have seen this style in pics/social, but not out in public."
femalefashionadvice,My cousin wears them over lace bodysuits. It's a cute look tbh
femalefashionadvice,The West Coast of the US - I got a lot of use out of mine when I lived over there. Now I’m in the midwest and pull mine out during those two weeks lol
femalefashionadvice,It seems all nice cozy sweaters and those big arms that don't fit well or are so uncomfortable under winter coats! That's a pain. Also living in a very cold climate and liking skirts- the right length of cost to fit with multiple midi/ maxi skirt lengths is a pain. Wide leg pants I love- but winter walking on snow- how does anytime keep them clean!!
femalefashionadvice,Omg this is actually kind of brilliant
femalefashionadvice,"I think its foot shape based and you have to have an impeccable fit. I've found the ones with just one strap are a little better than close toe, but I need to be sure to adjust foot placement occassionally still."
femalefashionadvice,"Jeez, related, any unbuttoned cardigans at all. On tv when people wear a regular cardigan unbuttoned it drapes perfectly over their chest and stays put. If I leave it unbuttoned, it flaps open, falls to the side, and I lose my figure."
femalefashionadvice,"Jeans lol. Specifically, if I were to wear jeans, I would want a straight leg, mid rise jean. I have a 10 inch difference between my waist and hips and very thick thighs. While I appreciate that there are a lot more curvy fits now, most of them have too much stretch for me, they're almost all super high waist (maybe they appear too high waist on me bc of my proportions), and sometimes the straight leg is really a skinny jean if you have thick legs, especially because of the stretch issue. I don't like wide leg, and I've tried buying a more relaxed jean style hoping it will fit like straight leg on me but it doesn't look quite right. I haven't owned jeans for several years now because I got tired of trying on jeans that didn't work out."
femalefashionadvice,Sleeveless bodysuits from commando or spanx
femalefashionadvice,"I agree with your first statement. I definitely don’t find my legs or feet get too cold. As long as I have a warm coat, I can wear a mini even in 30 degree weather as long as I’m not outside for a super long time."
femalefashionadvice,"•Short dresses with long sleeves. There is no good weather for these where I live. I’m going to be either cold or sweaty. In the dead of winter, I don’t even like these with tights because inevitably I’ll wind up indoors somewhere with the heat cranked way up, and having no way to take off a layer or ventilate feels suffocating.

•Any closed toe shoe that isn’t a sneaker or boot. All no-show socks fall off my ankle and gather under my foot. I’ve tried many brands and assume this is due to my foot shape. If it’s cold out, I’ll want tights and boots anyway. 

•One sleeved anything. Just no. How can this feel good? 

•Most crop tops with sleeves. It’s not okay if it rides up over, or gathers around my boobs when I raise my arms. I asked my friends and their consensus solutions were dress tape and not raising their arms. My solution is not to wear stuff like this. 

•Cutout dresses or swimsuits = cold body or possible weird tan lines. Nope. 

•Low or lower mid rise pants. I was 19 years old in 2000 and that’s more or less all that was available and worn by anyone within 20 years of my age. I spent what’s typically considered the best-looking years of someone’s life with a complex about my body. I thought there was something wrong with me because the predominant silhouettes (low waisted with longer, fitted, layered tops) do absolutely nothing for my barely 5’4 figure that kind of just barely meets the criteria for a soft hourglass shape. I felt like I had bulges all over, because the clothes cut into my widest, softest areas. Come to find out a few years ago, the high waisted and “mom” type jeans (straight-ish without pleats or puffiness) look amazing on me.  I think I would have liked my body more in my 20s if these styles weren’t completely taboo."
femalefashionadvice,"That sweater is definitely not dressy, it's really casual. I'd wear it casually with leggings/sweats at home, straight jeans for errands. Possibly with really really baggy jeans or cargo pants and big boots if I was going to wear it out but in that case I'd probably want it a couple sizes too big"
femalefashionadvice,"This might be something that only works for people with a particular foot shape. I have big, wide feet,and mules and backless clogs stay on for me pretty well without doing anything weird - provided they're wide enough to accommodate my feet in the first place. In particular, I feel like my feet are tall - like, the width is mostly from my midfoot being higher than average, which I think provides enough tension to keep these kinds of shoes on. I could see it being harder for people with narrow feet!"
femalefashionadvice,"For the knit tanks you mentioned - these are so great for business wear in the summer!  They layer well under blazers, but can be worn solo for the commute and are really cooling if they're made from cotton or linen or a blend.  I like them in warmer fabrics too under blazers in the colder months.  They don't make the arms of the blazer too tight, while still being professional."
femalefashionadvice,"I think overall, these work better when they’re in a thicker double layered material that is stretchy or an even thicker rib material reminiscent of the Aritzia rib"
femalefashionadvice,Re: 3 I think I would be more into it if the tops of the boots were visible OR if less boot was visible.
femalefashionadvice,Sun coverage is one I hadn’t thought of - I’d actually use a long-sleeve romper for this purpose (especially linen).
femalefashionadvice,"19 is everything. And the fleece handprints - hilarious, love those. I'm intrigued by the knee length. It's a tricky length but when done right it's quite nice."
femalefashionadvice,I had to totally leave these behind after I developed gait issues from MS
femalefashionadvice,I second the opinion that this sweater doesn’t really read dressy to me at all! This seems more like an outdoors type of sweater. What kind of dressy places are you looking to wear it?
femalefashionadvice,"I have a pair of round, silver, wire-framed glasses that I think look pretty OK with anything! They’re stylish but also not very obtrusive or noticeable. I wear them with my goth nightclub looks and with my goth corporate daytime looks, lol. They also are thin enough to show my makeup."
femalefashionadvice,I saw KT tape works as well as gaffers and it isn’t nearly as hard or painful to remove! I haven’t gotten myself any yet but I saw Tertaay try it and she has huge boobs haha
femalefashionadvice,"Yeah totally it’s the hiking clothes as lifestyle clothes trend, kind of the way athleisure is wearing gym clothes as lifestyle clothes 🥾"
femalefashionadvice,"I think that it depends on the height of the vamp. If it’s too low cut, it’s much more difficult to keep on."
femalefashionadvice,"Also a fast walker. Thicker or stiffer fabric helps with the leg wrap but I’ve learned to use the stair railing at home. Heck, I’ve even tripped going *up* the stairs."
femalefashionadvice,Thank you for asking this lol 😆 Hope you get a response haha
femalefashionadvice,Oh wow! I didn’t know this was a thing. It honestly looks like like great hiking gear.
femalefashionadvice,Chiming in to say I LOVE the kind of tops you posted! I find them super practical because the chunky knit texture makes it more forgiving for going braless. I Iive in Canada and manage to wear them all year round with a sweater or jacket over. They’re not too warm in the summer either.
femalefashionadvice,"Are there any stores that sell cool sweaters for children? I’m a very short woman who likes boxy sweaters and the cheapest/best-fitting ones that I’ve found have been sweaters for, like, actual kids, lol. But a lot of the kids’ sweaters look, well, kiddish, with glitter or sayings or whatever. Is there a store that sells nice looking sweaters for boys and girls?"
femalefashionadvice,"I'm 4'10 as well and really try to not limit myself because of it. There's a way to make most things work. 

As for the oversized blazer, it's important to have the proportions correct. Sleeves should end at the base of your thumb or higher, and the shoulder seam should be in line with where your upper arm ends. [Like this](https://images.app.goo.gl/gYVgMaPZoqEhWiDA7) as opposed to [this](https://images.app.goo.gl/wUHsA7i5VtB3Vizw5) where the shoulder juts out in an exaggerated way."
femalefashionadvice,I wonder who says that top is dressy because it’s definitely pretty casual. Sweaters like that are basically a part of the PNW uniform lol. Maybe some dress pants? It definitely leans more on the casual end of business casual
femalefashionadvice,I’ve been job searching since August with no results…feeling more and more unmotivated as the months go by.
femalefashionadvice,I would probably lean into going h2t gorpcore and search for gorpcore outfit inspiration.
femalefashionadvice,Fellow short muscular person here - I am clearly not the person kick flares were designed for.
femalefashionadvice,"To answer your question, without the sleeves on those knit tops, they’re actually really not all that warm. With a more open knit, I’ve worn them all the way through the summer as just a tank with shorts and jeans, including on beachy vacations. They’re typically not that much coverage when they’re crops and not made of the thickest material, so they’re comfortable. Might be a little warm if you get a lot of underboob sweat but if that’s not a problem for you, they’re fine."
femalefashionadvice,I'm getting married this Saturday and my fiance still hasn't gotten anything to wear! I'm stressing about it. He has an appointment with a stylist at Nordstrom on Thursday and I'm coming along. I hope he can find something because if he walks down the aisle in black jeans with a Black Flag shirt or something (a typical everyday outfit for him) I'm gonna be so pissed.
femalefashionadvice,I never realized how useful a lightweight raincoat could be until I was caught in a rainstorm in Dallas TX. Straight up felt like a jungle and it felt unnatural to me lol. I’m used to it being cold when it rains. My regular raincoats would have been stifling during a Texas summer monsoon so maybe it could be used for climates like that
femalefashionadvice,"Try Skintac adhesive wipes. I started to use them for my pasties to increase their useable life, but I believe the original purpose of these are medical use - specifically to serve as a barrier between skin and tape for protective reasons since people who have injuries have to do the tape on tape off thing a lot"
femalefashionadvice,"I wear prescription glasses and I don't know how to incorporate them into outfits for the club, concerts, general nightlife. Any suggestions?"
femalefashionadvice,"Honestly, I struggle to see how that could be dressy. Personally I would wear with [super-baggy pants](https://www.matchesfashion.com/products/Raey-Patch-pocket-drawstring-cotton-blend-trousers-1521405) if I wanted to be on trend, or [wide utility pants](https://www.matchesfashion.com/products/Raey-Wide-leg-pocket-front-trouser-1478179) for a more classic but still contemporary look. As hinted at by LL Bean, white pants (or mini) would smarten it up somewhat."
femalefashionadvice,"What is a reliable brand of tape? I tried it years ago and it was useless, but I feel like things have improved so much since then."
femalefashionadvice,Do you think [a men's size](https://golfknickers.com/argyle-socks-mens-over-the-calf-s-red-white/) would give you enough calf room?
femalefashionadvice,"I like 23 (sage dress w/black pants), 24 (Canadian tuxedo), 36 (red suit w/ camel coat) and 38 (white/grey/black medley) but some of those are “a choice” especially #3. What was she thinking? I’m all for excess but those boots are too big (fisherman waders anyone?). A stiffer more structured leather would have been better."
femalefashionadvice,Oooh I’ll have to look at those
femalefashionadvice,"Man I cannot get behind this particular cardigan trend. I know it’s intentional, but the stretched, open buttons and thin knits just make it look cheap. As if you bought a crappy sweater from Walmart that’s two sizes too small. Great example of something that only looks fashionable on skinny models with small boobs. I’d look ridiculous in those things"
femalefashionadvice,"Yeah I can’t speak to people with average legs but full length pants are definitely a bit too long for my shorter than average right now! 

I haven’t tried a mini dress in a long time. Maybe look for tall sizing?"
femalefashionadvice,"I like to wear them with chunky boots and sneakers, it balances them out really well."
femalefashionadvice,"Oh interesting, it actually never occurred to me to wear them as undergarments, but actually that sounds quite cozy."
femalefashionadvice,"I can't understand what body type pants are being made for. I'm well above average height at 5'9"" and I still have to get almost every pair hemmed...so like, are they designing for the small percentage of ladies who are 6 feet?  

AND THEN THERE'S MOTHERFUCKING DRESSES - specifically above-the-knee dresses - which are the exact opposite of pants. SO SHORT SO USELESS. My bum is hanging out of every mini dress I try on. 

So pants = made for really, really tall people. Dresses = made for really short people. Why is this happening."
femalefashionadvice,"I got bored after wearing leggings and t shirts during the pandemic. Also lost 20 pounds so I replaced most of my wardrobe. Thanks to this sub I found new things that worked. I am now 72, so yes my fashion has changed. This year I am on a no buying trend. It's been 2 months now. My last purchase was a pair of black patent leather Doc Martens."
femalefashionadvice,I knit my own bralettes out of wool and wear them to stay warm during the winter! They are thin and cropped and don’t take up a lot of room under my clothes or end up looking bulky.
femalefashionadvice,I like the cropped camisoles from Old Navy as a “basic” undershirt!
femalefashionadvice,"[Burlington Whitby socks](https://www.burlington.de/uk_en/p/whitby-women-knee-high-socks/22319_8226/) are well made and durable. They fit my 14.5"" calves comfortably so I think they would stretch a bit more if necessary."
femalefashionadvice,"Well. I'm just going to say it. 

I can't tuck in shirts or even wear shorter shirts because I have a large... muff. Camel toe. No matter what. I'm plus size"
femalefashionadvice,"I really love big flares, but how do people not get their legs caught up and trip?  I have a long, fast stride, and once those things get swinging, they have momentum, they're wrapping around my legs, it's kind of terrifying.  I've almost bit it going down the stairs a few times in the knitted flares I wear around the house."
femalefashionadvice,My solution has been to wear a strapless bra. I have one from wacoal that is surprisingly comfy and stays in place
femalefashionadvice,"Sock Dreams has two possible options here: [https://www.sockdreams.com/plus-size/plus-size-socks.html?pattern=13484](https://www.sockdreams.com/plus-size/plus-size-socks.html?pattern=13484). You could color in some of the diamonds on the black/white option. Re. knitting, a single pair of custom socks is probably not going to be cost-effective for you."
femalefashionadvice,"I am very short legged and find straight jeans look best slightly cropped. And then I wear them with any flat shoe: sneaker, loafer, ballet flats.

For some reason, full length makes me look stumpier."
femalefashionadvice,In Japan most people would *never* wear them on their own. They show way too much skin and are possibly also too fitted. Japanese people are very conservative in terms of appearing “sexy” or showing the contours of their bodies. The examples are spot on for Japanese style though!
femalefashionadvice,"I agree, I’ve only seen them worn over dresses or T-shirts in person."
femalefashionadvice,I would go for a thick strapped flatform such as the [Wolky Jewel](https://www.wolkyshop.co.uk/product/jewel-black-leather/) (podiatrist-approved and seriously comfortable for all day walking) or a [thick soled fisherman sandal](https://www.cos.com/en_gbp/women/accessories/shoes/product.leather-fisherman-sandals-black.1052291001.html).
femalefashionadvice,Even when I was 16 and 100 lbs I had that little armpit roll that would pooch out over the top.  Not great.
femalefashionadvice,Sheer shirts. Can never find the best undershirt.
femalefashionadvice,Of course in Japan most people would *never* wear them on their own. They show way too much skin and are possibly also too fitted. Your examples are spot on for Japanese style though!
femalefashionadvice,"I would, but I don't mind having my boobs out.  I don't have much to see."
femalefashionadvice,"Part of me wonders if they put double sided tape on their feet so the shoes stay on…But that would be far too much trouble, right?"
femalefashionadvice,"Not a solution for every day all day ""getting in the way"" but if it's specifically for hand washing, dishes, etc. at home, I often keep a few of those cheap super thin elastics that go around herbs and produce by my kitchen sink so I can quickly tie back whatever sleeve is in the way."
femalefashionadvice,"Have you tried to size down 1-2 sizes? I find this gives me just enough support that they’re wearable, as long as its a thicker/less stretchy fabric."
femalefashionadvice,Sleeveless knit tanks are great for fall/winter here in Florida where it’s not humid and the breeze is cool enough to make the fabric comfortable
femalefashionadvice,I’ve thought about boob tape but I’m overwhelmed by the options. What brand did you use and do you have any tips for getting it off painlessly? I’m about to have a baby and hope to breastfeed so would like to avoid any additional booby pain lol
femalefashionadvice,"Same, I actually think I may be allergic because I ended up with horrible bubbling/welts from the damn stuff."
femalefashionadvice,"These are just for Instagram, I swear. No one could wear this in public comfortably."
femalefashionadvice,"I always push my sleeves up when i need to do something, otherwise they are fun to flourish"
femalefashionadvice,"Ruffles. I fucking hate them. 

Also, the oversized jacket/sweater trend just doesn’t work on me as a short, pear shaped woman. I’m a size 4/6, but baggy and oversized stuff makes me look like I gained 40 lbs. I wish I could pull off the massive blazer or massive varsity jacket look."
femalefashionadvice,"When I was 95 lbs (43kg), I had a pooch and still do now as I weigh more. So will most people at most weights. It's normal for bodies to hold onto fat at the stomach, so it's not about weight. Bodies just distribute fat in different ways. It's certainly not a disaster, or something you have to try to get rid of.

Do you want to hide your pooch, or are you asking us if you should hide it? I don't think you should hide it, if you don't want to. I still wear tight dresses that end up showing my pooch - I like how I look in them anyway! And if someone is actually shallow enough to judge me for that, then they're not someone whose opinion I value. If you like how you look and feel in your skirts and dresses, keeprocking them.

If you want to hide your pooch, you can wear more styles that draw attention away from it. Prints, patterns, and textures (all of which I use myself to avoid wearing bras lol). Skirts/dresses that flare out at the waist, have more structure instead of clingy/tight, or made of a fabric that drapes/has pleats."
femalefashionadvice,34HH here. I size down 1-2 sizes and scoop and swoop!
femalefashionadvice,"I alter/shorten them. I had a blouse that had a ruffled cuff with lace trim... it was a game changer when I shortened them to slightly above my wrist or 3/4 length. Full sleeves are normally oversized on me anyway (petite problems), so it was the gamble!

If they have an elastic (or room to add an elastic), ties, or sleeve cuff trims, they can be shortened. If it's a true knit, you'll need to bind the fabric on an overlock machine and cover up with a fabric trim."
femalefashionadvice,You look incredible and I love your approach to wardrobe building.
femalefashionadvice,What an incredible outfit.
femalefashionadvice,"I love tank knits as a base layer under my sweaters or as something to wear under a cardigan. They help add coziness on cold days.

The trends I’m not into are those “hacks” for getting the waistband of your pants to fit better. Just take them to a tailor. Also, the resurgence of the whale tail/undie waistband. I just can’t get into that. I feel like it just says “I’m trying way to hard to be sexy” or something."
femalefashionadvice,They remind me of Cher in Clueless. She pairs those little crop sweaters with long sleeve sheer button downs underneath.
femalefashionadvice,"I’ve knit a few tank tops with wool. Wool without acrylic is actually a little bit more comfortable than one might expect in warmer weather (like 60s). I tend to wear them layered with other items like a denim jacket, or over a t shirt. I also like wearing them sometimes when I go to bars in the winter because they’re a little warmer than a normal going out top"
femalefashionadvice,"5’4” here. I wear platforms, loafers, Chucks, boots…whatever. I have accepted I am short and just go with it. I couldn’t wear heels all the time."
femalefashionadvice,I love searching Reformation on Poshmark/eBay for tops like this. I feel their stuff is overpriced buying new at retail but there is so much to look through on the secondhand sites and a lot of it hits your requests.
femalefashionadvice,"What’s a good way to style this llbean sweatshirt? https://www.llbean.com/llb/shop/119312?page=quilted-quarter-zip-pullover&amp;bc=12-27-886&amp;feat=886-GN3&amp;csp=f&amp;pos=1

I’m obsessed with it and have it in 3 colors but never know what to wear it with or how to make it look as dressy as everyone claims it’s to be!"
femalefashionadvice,* Would love to wear them year around. Nervous about trial and error for finding the best skin colored leggings.
femalefashionadvice,"Pasties with bodysuits that aren’t long sleeved or like t-shirts, yup. If a backless dress isn’t thin, I just don’t wear a bra."
femalefashionadvice,Lol. I think those people must have a very different stride than I do. Have flung many a mule ahead of me.
femalefashionadvice,Can you tell me the brand of which fleece lined leggings one you like? I have a very dress and skirt heavy wardrobe. Would love to wear the
femalefashionadvice,"https://preview.redd.it/h1ep0rt160la1.jpeg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=f6e5460eeacabd23e3d743b5370f03b886137950

Here’s the logo! I this is a mirror image of my left leg."
femalefashionadvice,"Body suits. For me, it's actually easier to deal with the snaps than tucking a shirt every time I pee, and I'm a frequent pee-r too."
femalefashionadvice,"Yes to lightweight trenches. At what time of year can these be worn??? Like two weeks in the fall or spring?? They look like rain coats, but usually don’t have a hood?? 

I feel like they are only practical for people who live in extremely moderate climates"
femalefashionadvice,"Taking off boob tape is terrifying and painful. Left me with scrapes and rug burn for weeks, even though I used oil to try and remove it. 

I did it for a backless plunge dress and I’d rather have no cleavage and go breed than bust out the boob tape again."
femalefashionadvice,"I think it’s hard to stick to the same looks totally for years on end. You can stick to an aesthetic and update according to new trends that you connect with.

Personally I don’t stick to one aesthetic. I would get too bored. As I’ve gotten older my style has changed as well. When I was younger I thought midi and maxi dresses were frumpy, now I don’t like wearing mini skirts or dresses. I was more alternative as a teen/in my twenties. Now I have a lot more professional clothes, and basics. I always have some interesting/boho/eclectic pieces that I love sprinkled throughout my closet.

I have a hard time buying less, but I’m trying. I’m also trying to be more thoughtful about what I buy- is it filling a true gap in my closet? Is it good quality or will it fall apart within a few months? Does it fit/flatter or do I just like the idea of it? 

While I do continue buying, I have plenty of things that are thrifted, vintage or that I’ve personally owned for 15 years if they’re still in good shape. I try to be responsible when getting rid of clothes. I sell a lot on poshmark and mercari because I feel that people who pay for an item will use it and treasure it and it’s less likely to go in a landfill- which happens frequently with donated items. Stuff I don’t think will sell I’m sending in a bag to be recycled (check out the brand “For Days”, they do this), or for old tattered jeans bringing to madewell for their recycling program."
femalefashionadvice,Agreed. They also give me the modesty that I need to feel comfortable with a shorter hem. I don’t wear them in the dead of summer though
femalefashionadvice,"I wear both heels and sneakers with full length straight jeans, but unless the jeans are slightly cropped I find shoes that are very close to the ground result in my pants legs dragging à la 2000s soggy bell bottoms. 

You didn’t ask but I like wearing ballet flats with trouser socks for a more modern twist."
femalefashionadvice,Boob tape!!
femalefashionadvice,"Seconding boob tape. I'm 36G and just assumed bras were my only option. Boob tape is amazing! 

Awful to get off though."
femalefashionadvice,"Flat mules. Do your feet have some magic grippy property mine are missing? Do you just teleport from place to place so you never have to walk? Or do you just put up with blisters on the bottom of your toes from curling them into your shoes to keep them from flying off? (That was my move in the early aughts when I had a couple pair, but I can't go back.)"
femalefashionadvice,"As others have recommended, Klassy Network has lots of options with built-in bras

I find that the cheap silicone nip covers can be seen through most shirts, but if you get the more expensive ones (like b six nippies), they are much higher quality and lay flush against the skin."
femalefashionadvice,"I'd immediately gravitate towards styling the sweater vests you linked like this clueless outfit with the thin longer blouse underneath.

https://preview.redd.it/et49z8cn50la1.png?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=dff95a191cf8228d24105b9d5ccf0983f44bae13

That's probably more suited to warmer temperatures, but for winter you could similarly later it on top of a thin, warm layer or put a cardigan over it."
femalefashionadvice,"Some people burn more easily in specific areas and never get sunburns in others. 

The short rompers with long-sleeves are for those like me - super sensitive with upper arm burn, in spite of putting on sunscreen. I never got a burn anywhere else. Not even on my nose. 

Sunburns... are quite painful. And it sucks when they're severe on your upper arm. You'll be out of commission for awhile. It's why I love summery fabrics with long-sleeves, including Eileen Fisher's linen cardigans to top summer dresses."
femalefashionadvice,H&amp;M! I wish they were a hair longer or I was a hair shorter lol. But I don't think it's too big of a problem.
femalefashionadvice,Do you been that your foot slides forward and your toes are crammed together? Might try an insert like [these](https://www.amazon.com/Kaps-Flower-Cushion-Invisible-high-Heels/dp/B072HNZYWK/ref=sr_1_1?crid=361PLPYQYEZOD&amp;keywords=Kaps+lady+flowers&amp;qid=1677174199&amp;sprefix=kaps+lady+flowers%2Caps%2C187&amp;sr=8-1)
femalefashionadvice,I feel like the only practical option to this trend is getting a cardigan that fits fairly tight with [more than one tie](https://www.nordstrom.com/s/tie-front-cotton-rib-cardigan/7333230?color=OFFWHITE&amp;utm_content=9383769113&amp;utm_term=aud-1024105537894:pla-316456057893&amp;utm_channel=low_nd_shopping_standard&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_campaign=645528200&amp;adpos=&amp;creative=57188931473&amp;device=m&amp;matchtype=&amp;network=g&amp;acctid=21700000001689570&amp;dskeywordid=92700049882385600&amp;lid=92700049882385600&amp;ds_s_kwgid=58700005465915029&amp;ds_s_inventory_feed_id=97700000007631122&amp;dsproductgroupid=316456057893&amp;product_id=7106078&amp;merchid=1243147&amp;prodctry=US&amp;prodlang=en&amp;channel=online&amp;storeid=&amp;locationid=9026841&amp;targetid=aud-1024105537894:pla-316456057893&amp;campaignid=645528200&amp;adgroupid=9383769113&amp;gbraid=0AAAAAD8eAElnW139gZ4V2aSVQ3AprQk4u&amp;gbraid=0AAAAAD8eAElnW139gZ4V2aSVQ3AprQk4u&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiA6fafBhC1ARIsAIJjL8nGlyZRtKsMZaXvDhDdseUY39_Unjv6dirpE2QOfx3bQvaMVn1xhRUaAqSBEALw_wcB&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds) so that you don’t flash everyone
femalefashionadvice,"I have lots of long sleeve/short dresses but they’re mostly cotton and linen, so very breathable. I wear them all spring and summer in the southeast, it’s great for some sun coverage"
femalefashionadvice,"I think people are super individual in how cold their exposed legs get and/or they've trained themselves to endure it. (Shout out to the bro in the supermarket parking lot this past Sunday who was wearing basketball shorts, sneakers, and a hoodie while I was wearing jeans, boots, a tank top, a sweater, a giant teddy coat, and a beanie, with mittens in my bag just in case. Srsly, there are Boston guys who never put away their shorts.)  But, as you can see from my aside, I am not one of those people. I have a heavy cotton utility-style romper with long sleeves that is cute AF that I believe I've worn twice just because of this issue. If I were younger and more fashion-forward, I'd wear it with tights which would open up a lot more days it would be weather-appropriate."
femalefashionadvice,"I just learned about boob tape! I didn’t think it would work for me because I am also a member of the big old titty committee, but it did! I watched a few YouTube videos on using boob tape for large breasts, and I’ve honestly never looked better. It’s opened up a world of fashion possibilities for me."
femalefashionadvice,"I have a bra extender strap that snaps to the back of my regular bra and let’s me wrap it around my belly, letting me wear some more low back things, but definitely not fully backless. I will also wear lacy bralettes and just let them show if it’s not a formal event. Cosabella’s ultra curvy mine makes pretty ones that fit me well as a 34h cup."
femalefashionadvice,"Looking for low heeled sandals that are somewhat practical to walk in? Ideally something with close toe/some coverage because, as much as I want to be body positive, I have the ugliest feet I've ever seen. I'm thinking a Mary Jane, and j crew has a great option, but their shoes are always too thin for my feet."
femalefashionadvice,"Leather jackets. Lightweight trenches. 

Also batwing shirts, poncho fits, anything that's hard to pull a coat over. It's ironic that a lot of the cute cozy winter styles are impossible to wear with a coat."
femalefashionadvice,"Straight jeans, petite woman. Do you guys wear heels all the time? Or prefer going with sneakers? Do ballet flats go with it?"
femalefashionadvice,There are so many stylish and dignified jumpsuits but I am too pear shaped for any of them to fit well. I can sometimes find a loose short romper that will fit the ol’ badonk but those are few and far between.
femalefashionadvice,"In winter I wear my short dresses with super thick fleece-lined skin-colored ice skating tights, with whatever tights I like layered over them. They're way warmer than pants, and too thick to layer under pants, so ironically I end up wear short skirts on the coldest days."
femalefashionadvice,"Klassy Network, Buzzoms, and Frankly Apparel have some of these style options and are more big boob friendly with built in boobs! For tops that are cute I generally axe them out unless they will allow for creative boob taping though

If anyone has any other options would love to hear em because I used to have small boobs and I miss my dainty lil stewpot tops damnit"
femalefashionadvice,So I’m an avid knitter and moved to SoCal recently. I often use linen/cotton yarn but you’d be surprised how nice a soft wool like merino is in the summer. It’s super breathable and can have good airflow. Put me in wool over synthetic fibers in summer any day!  There are some scratchy wools out there so you gotta feel them first.
femalefashionadvice,"I have so many square neck tops/bodysuits that I LOVE but can never wear because I don’t know what kind of bra to wear with it. I can’t seem to find smooth/seamless bras that won’t show the straps. I need one that’s low cut (balconette maybe?) where the straps sit on the mid/outer side of my shoulders. 

I’ve also tried sticky bras &amp; nip covers, but the sticky bras make me sweat so much that it soaks through my shirt, and the outline of the covers can be seen through most shirts."

femalefashionadvice,"That sweater tank in the first example is cute!

femalefashionadvice,There are Winter tights that are lined with warm fuzzies.
femalefashionadvice,I love dresses with long sleeves! I find that long sleeves (light colored and light weight fabric) keep me cooler in warm weather than no sleeves or short sleeves. It keeps the sun off my arms and they don't feel burning hot like they would if they were exposed to the sun directly.
femalefashionadvice,I think [one-sleeve shirts](https://us.shein.com/One-Shoulder-Fitted-Top-p-1538541-cat-1738.html) make it look like you got dressed in a rush cos your house was on fire or something. (One-side sleeveless formal dresses are fine.)

femalefashionadvice,"The short skirts can be good for a little layering, too!

I tend toward a goth/witchy style sometimes and I have a black long-sleeved short-skirt dress that I only wear in cooler weather because I absolutely do sweat buckets whenever I try to wear it on warmer days. I layer it with a pair of tights (thickness/pattern will depend on how cold it is, sometimes I’ll let the tights be the “pop” of color on the outfit too), followed by mid-calf dark socks under some comfy boots (I only own ankle-height boots, so I’ll roll the socks down a little bit to frame them &amp; make them more noticeable). Then I layer the whole thing with a jacket that’s at least knee-length to offset the shortness of the skirt.

I could see someone using knee-high or thigh-high socks with taller boots and a shorter jacket, too! It’s a versatile-ish piece once I realized it *definitely* wasn’t stylable for summer &amp; I had to stick to more autumnal tactics with it :)"

I can do an easy on jumpsuit as a single layer, but having to take a separate shirt off too is just too much. Even moreso if I have a crossbody bag on too, which is often how I see it styled."

I’ve TRIED to get into oversized blazers but they are simply always TOO BIG to wear them in a good way. I haven’t cracked the code for it yet."
femalefashionadvice," **Recent experiences with Few Moda?**

I am looking to buy a few dresses this year for some events I have coming up and found Few Moda recently. It seems like it’s a great deal even with the membership option, but I am skeptical and don’t see a ton of recent reviews anywhere.

There is a review about a year ago where some people had issues with CS and returns/refunds which concerns me. But I’m wondering if the experience has gotten better since then.

When buying online I typically buy several sizes with plans to return ones that don’t fit so a decent return/refund experience is important to me. It seems that their return policy is pretty standard.

Have any of your purchased from them recently? If so, what has your experience been? Any downsides? Any issues with returns/exchanges? How is the quality?"
femalefashionadvice,"Love me some tank knits. Spring or fall! Or winter, with layers. 

Offhand:

-	my boobs won’t stay in shirts with boob jails 
-	it’s challenging to find full length pants (eg wide pants) that are the right length for my short legs. Petite sizes in my length sell out fast, and sometimes even petite length is too long or not offered. Tidy cuffs take more finesse to get harmonious on wide jeans (I’ve been talked into submission by u/cattiemount and u/blackbir that deep cuffs can be stylish.. but I maintain they are more challenging to get right :) I like it when cuffs “just work!”) Flares can’t necessarily be hemmed. 
-	I like it when I can comfortably wear a bra with things, so trends that don’t cover bra straps are not ideal 
-	shoe comfort is important. On a similar note, I find anything requiring no show socks or closed shoes that are worn without socks to be fussy to maintain 
-	I’m a pass on heavy earrings, also for comfort reasons 
-	In general, I go for an elevated basics aesthetic. Certain trends, or lots of trends at once, can feel a little more youthful than my style goals (eg fuzzy bucket hats in bright colors)"
femalefashionadvice,"Blouses with the ruffled cuffs, always getting in the way, hard to wash your hands, etc. They look cute but not at all functional"
femalefashionadvice,"This may not be the solution you want, but I typically reserve those items for winter (especially if it’s a dress) and just wear with tights. Or I’ll wear them on summer days when it’s no warmer than 75 degrees/if I’m going into the office that day where I can throw a blanket over my lap if I get too cold."
femalefashionadvice,After my hysterectomy my stomach has been big and swollen so I don’t participate in those fashions but if I did I would probably wear mom jeans with a little flare (or a lot depending on the shirt/outfit) and a nice belt.

femalefashionadvice,"I've got you on the tank knits for summer. A 1) loose fitting, 2) chunky cotton or linen yarn, in a 3) open-ish weave, is *delightful* for hot summer weather. The breeze goes right through it, since it's loose and off your body it doesn't trap heat, and cotton or linen don't hold funk and heat like synthetics do. Something that looks like [this](https://www.lulus.com/products/get-the-look-white-loose-knit-sweater-tank-top/1144302.html), or [this](https://www.amazon.com/Flawerwumen-Sweater-Sleeveless-Pullover-Sweaters/dp/B086DR4XYC), with a pair of linen joggers or palazzo pants, is my go to outfit for when it's too hot to think - I live in the US Southeast, so that's about 6 months out of the year."
femalefashionadvice,"Short dresses with long sleeves, or alternately, shorts-rompers with long sleeves.

If it’s hot enough for me to be wearing shorts or a shirt skirt, I’m going to be sweating bullets in long sleeves. The inverse (long skirt/pants and short sleeves) doesn’t present the same issues due to the possibility of layering."

I decided that I would just pick out some of my saved outfits in Stylebook and wear one a day, even if I only put it on for 10 minutes and then change back into my comfy clothes. I feel like I'm out of practice and familiarity with my clothes/how they fit so this will just be a fun little exercise to boost my confidence.

femalefashionadvice,"You call them “skinny jeans”. I call them “jeans that fit”. 
I don’t understand why Gen Z kids are so into wearing things that *don’t fit them*. 

Skinny jeans? Fine. Slim fit? No problem. 

But the baggy/boxy/cropped/whatever stuff they are all wearing doesn’t even look like a fashion trend. It just looks like they are buying things that don’t fit. 

If you could fit both legs into one side of your pants, they don’t fit. 

If two people could wear your sweater at once, it doesn’t fit. 

If your top doesn’t reach the top button of your jeans, you’re going to have a cold back. 

This is like the JNCO phase all over again and it looks silly af.

femalefashionadvice,"Thank you for telling me about lower wool content socks. I think I will try out those kinds of socks. It could be a good compromise otherwise I might just go for synthetic for light and durable socks. 

I did check out Danish Endurance on Amazon, but it seems like most of the socks I saw had acrylic in them, which I think of as more a winter material. 

I searched on YouTube and ground Innotree which also does cheap socks on Amazon. Their model from a few years ago which had 40-50% wool might have worked for me (3 pack for $20). But reading reviews the current model which has 60-80% wool might be more prone to losing shape. 

The search continues! I have found that the founders of Smartwool broke away from the brand about 15 years ago and started their own brand Point6 socks. Doesn’t seem much cheaper but there might be deals…

I think the founders left around the same time Smartwool was bought by Northface, and then finally bought by VF company, which also owns icebreakers.  

Cabot and Sons is the founders behind Darn Tough, but possibly a discontinued line. Some socks may be around still. The same mill also made JCrew and L.L. Bean socks before making Darn Tough socks, and the manufacturers said that J. Crew and L. L Bean went to Korea and one other Asian country I’ve forgotten. 

Actually I started reading some brochures from a Swedish yarn manufacturing company, which sources from New Zealand Merino Company, which also sources Smartwool, Icebreaker, and various other mid to high end brands, including Loro Piana. They have a 2016 pie chart that says China is actually the single biggest producer of merino wool now, and they have 21% of the market, compared to 1990 when they had 7%. Australia was the biggest producer in 1990 with 33% of the market then, and now has 19%. China certainly had massive growth in wool. Could explain why brands are moving off seas… 

Anyway it seems like one of the ways sock companies try to distinguish from each other is by the seamless quality of their toe seam. Socks are knit as a tube with an open gap at the toe, which has to be closed with a seam. Sock manufacturers highlight their ability to do a flat, seamless, almost invisible seam there, which is relatively new tech I guess (last ten or twenty years). 

Also the reason why Darn Tough socks are so dense is that they are made three times their final size, then shrunk down. 

And Darn Tough also does factory sales in Vermont where their manufacturing plant is. While Smartwool does sales at their plant In Tennessee."

femalefashionadvice,"I did overalls, jumpsuits and rompers after my last surgery. Scars were all over my stomach so I couldn’t even try to move the waistband around. Later when things improved I went for pull up linen pants with looser waistbands and that got me through the summer season.

I’ve always disliked TRR for their shady “authentication” practices.

I was glad I got my money back but even the Goodwill would know that was a terrible fake.

I have finally gotten around to dying the three dresses. Here is one of them for reference

Now I just need to seam rep and sew the dress but before I just dive into it I would really love some guidance concerning the best way to go about it.

---------------------

If anyone has any advice I would really love to hear it!

Thanks!"
femalefashionadvice,Hey! We’re about the same height and weight. I usually wear blazers and long vests that contrast my dress. And I usually wear dark monochrome dress/ top and skirt. I find that works best
femalefashionadvice,"Ugh, thank you!!!"
femalefashionadvice,"Look, weight, BMI, stomach, pooch, etc, has absolutely nothing, let me emphasize this, *nothing*, to do with whether or not you can have a good style or fashion sense or wear clothing. I get why you seem to feel this way, it is how a lot of diet culture stuff gets shoved in, but the way your comment is worded is really kinda… phobic sounding. That doesn’t really fly here, since this sub is very body acceptance heavy and we help people here of all shapes and sizes. Because everyone should be able to feel good in their body and in their clothes. This is why you got a couple downvoted and gotten what seems to be a now mod-deleted not super nice comment. 

That being said, on to your question. 

So essentially, if you are looking to *hide* this feature, you’re going to need your shape info for us to provide flattering recommendations. This will be more based on your ratio between measurements and your proportions. For example, I have a slim waist compared to my larger hip and bust measurements, making me more of an hourglass shape. How clothes work for us (because clothes are meant to work for our bodies, not our bodies for clothes) and what clothes seem traditionally flattering will change based on this shape. 

Knowing what type of skirts/dresses you went for will also be helpful in helping you understand what about their shape/fit/fabric isn’t helpful, since this too, can vary and despite what you may think initially, is not so simple as just “tight = visible pooch”

I can help and would be happy to provide some recommendations based on these and what kind of aesthetic/style you’re interested in, it’s one of my fave things to help people with here. 

More generally speaking: if hiding your stomach is a priority, you may want to try

1. More structured fabrics. This I know seems counterintuitive, as these offer less stretch, but… Things like tweed and denim hold shape and structure more than stretchier fabrics, meaning that they provide and define a form where perhaps you feel you have less in a way you find flattering.

2. a line or flared skirts/dresses these in a structured fabric also flare outward from your stomach slightly, providing visual interest and volume in another location, which draws the eye away from this point you’d prefer to hide

3. Wrap skirts are super flexible on sizing and are super flowy, allowing again more visual interest elsewhere 

I can provide more detailed reccs based on your measurements specifically, since beyond this there’s quite a bit of variety. 

You and I are around the same height and weight, I’m a bit shorter as I fall in the petite category, and a smidge heavier (I’m freaking like half boob over here lmao), a belly pooch is a perfectly normal thing at *any* size because as your doc said, our uteruses take up space. When I was your age a couple years back I was lighter than you and still had it cause it’s NORMAL. Not to mention bloating and a full stomach and eating all cause a pooch throughout the day anyways even if you rip your uterus and all that out, because food has to go somewhere when you eat it during your day. I post plenty in WAYWT, and though I don’t hide my pooch purposely, most of my outfits simply create visual interest elsewhere which means it just doesn’t draw other people’s eye to that spot. Often commenters are surprised by my weight, height, and proportions because you can dress just as awesome around it. Your stomach’s existence, I promise you, is not something that will ruin your sense of style or your outfits. There are ways to hide it, there are ways to draw the eye elsewhere so it’s not noticeable, both of these are great, but please do not ever feel either is necessary, especially not in this subreddit."

I love my Pandora rings because they absolutely do not tarnish and have so far lasted me years without ever taking them off, and I like their range of prices and constant sales. However, they don't come out with new styles often, so I'm looking for some new options."
femalefashionadvice,"Not sure if you want to go down this rabbit hole, but there is drama on TikTok right now revealing alleged shady practices at the Real Real that you may be interested in. Keep lots of documentation."
femalefashionadvice,I would consider this black tie! Maybe a satin black top in a similar cut to the model's?
femalefashionadvice,I went to a barn wedding once and floral/flowy dresses were definitely a hit
femalefashionadvice,maybe a blazer with whatever feels comfortable on the bottom maybe or a jumpsuit if you're into that?
femalefashionadvice,"East Asia has always been slightly ahead when it comes to fashion trends. 

And yes I find it really interesting the amount of people complaining about looser styles making them look fatter. Like what exactly is it about skinny jeans that makes them more ‘flattering’? They highlight your actual body. If you’re a size 16, skinny jeans won’t make you look like a size 2. And there’s nothing wrong with not looking like a size 2. The idea that ‘flattering’ fashion means it must make one look thin is also really dated. 

Also some of the women complaining are essentially insulting all other women, ‘the trendy styles flatter NO ONE’."
femalefashionadvice,I actually got a tank like that from abercrombie last year you should check if they have them again or maybe hollister
femalefashionadvice,It feels like Pinterest keeps showing me similar variations of the same 3 outfits.
femalefashionadvice,"It's absolutely fine in dress code terms, but it's not appropriate for the weather and the likely level of the restaurant heating, which is probably designed to accommodate men in suits. I would find a dress or top that you can wear without a cover up indoors, and add a coat that you can drop in the cloakroom when you arrive."
femalefashionadvice,This is a great post! Thank you OP
femalefashionadvice,"I’ll see if I have the pics on this phone, find the dress and take pics (how do I upload to Reddit) or find a similar one online. Give me til tomorrow night( or your time now)"
femalefashionadvice,"Probably. I think the actual type of color used in the picture might be a bishop collar/standing collar but i dont know how difficult/easy it is to aquire a black shirt with that collar, so the turtle neck sounds like the best approximation."
femalefashionadvice,id go with something else and call ahead to see what the expect.
femalefashionadvice,"good ideas! ill try to play around with it a little more, thanks for the tips!"
femalefashionadvice,"thats what i was worried about. you think if i have cardigan over it or something, it would be appropriate?? or is it just too bodycon-y for it to be good choice?"
femalefashionadvice,"cute dress im sure your date would love it, but i wouldn't wear that to high end restaurant as it doesn't cover shoulders."
femalefashionadvice,"here is real picture

femalefashionadvice,"There's @kendalljennercloset - they post more often in stories. For Kaia, I only know of @stylesofkaiagerber, who probably post less than you'd like"
femalefashionadvice,"Omg I adore them, their sizing if you’re mid sized/hourglass shaped for bottoms tbh sucks, but I have the midi cocktail skirt despite this, and have rented a few tops and dresses and always love those

Other lil shops I like:

Aym studio for shapewear-esque dresses, love love love, size inclusive, small woman owned business and and so flattering. The only body con dresses I wear

Tuesday of California is a cute small business for kitschy fun stuff. Used to have a collared dress with daggers on each collar from them? Wore the thing to death 

If I ever go down the expensive mini bag route for some reason I already know Jacquelement is who is getting my money. 

Shop Kikay is a queer owned business I’ve been into for years, and invented these clothes rack hangers for earrings? I have two of them filled with stuff I’ve bought from them over the years. My ears could be miss frizzle if I tried

Calamityware if you ever need fun dishes and serving ware, looks like traditional blue china but… robots and dinosaurs and the loch ness monster. First thing I put on our wedding registry when we made it lmao

Studio Cult Co for funky bags and funky jewelry. Do I *need* a bread tag shaped purse? No. Do I have it bookmarked just in case I ever do? Sure

Frankly Apparel, Klassy Network, and Buzzoms are all in my saves to check out over time for braless yet big boob friendly options

Wolf and Badger is an awesome spot to find a huge range of items at various price points. From well known to smaller designers. Always know I’m going to be the only one at an event rolling up in small brands I find there

House of Sunny I have a few items from and actually am pretty pleased with! I’ve got a knit dress and bright green knit pair of flare pants, as well as a biker vest, two of those are super frequent wears for me. 

Selkie is made out of demon spawn hair or something, it’s itchy as hell, instead Maison Amory is similar in aesthetic and a sister brand that I’ve yet to try but hear way better things about the construction of

Leze the Label though is a workhorse for the fall/winter for me. Freaking work looking pants that are cozy like sweatpants? And they’re ungodly amounts of stretchy? So comfy. I’ve got three pairs of pants from them from when I was doing on call work and needed to be up and dressed well and out of the house in the middle of the night in 10 minutes 

I… think that’s all my lesser known saved stuff?"
femalefashionadvice,"Consider this: What if you see a defect where there is none. I saw this ad the other day, and this woman is gorgeous!..

Srs/ OP you're an angel. Any chance you can do this for tops and skirts as well? The crop tops just seem so intimidating in winter. 😅"
femalefashionadvice,"Wearing workout clothing to run errands at the grocery store and various coffee shops is totally the thing to do.  Not just any athleisure wear - very nice athleisure wear.  People notice - down to the handbag one carries with their athleisure wear.  The Buckhead crowd is usually thinner than the norm, especially older ladies.  Wearing black leggings, a zip jacket in a bright color, gray sneakers, big sunglasses, heavy 14kt gold jewelry, and perfectly done hair and nails finish the look.  The puffy vest is very popular here, too - except when you need to wear your short camel coat or short white jacket with sleeves.  Logos are considered tasteless and monograms are the rule.  Men wear the standard khaki pants, blue button down polo shirt, alligator belt, leather loafers without socks and tortoise shell frames on glasses/sunglasses.  Everyone buys their own personal grocery sacks from Whole  Foods - they never carry the brown paper sack out of the grocery store.  Nails are big in Atlanta - shorter nails for the caucasian community done in shades of white/cream, red or cajun shrimp color.  No one complains about the hot weather in Atlanta.  It shows you aren't from here or used to it.  One should just know Atlanta is hot in the summer."
femalefashionadvice,"So where I live (northern Canada) and in many other places there are several months a year where warm snow boots are non-negotiable. And I think tucking wide leg pants into boots is kind of weird, and wide leg OVER the boots also looks weird/bulky. I live in skinny/slim jeans in the winter for this reason. Looking forward to spring when I can break out my wide legs though."
femalefashionadvice,I love these boots!
femalefashionadvice,Those boots!
femalefashionadvice,thank you for looking!! i’ll try posting there(:
femalefashionadvice,"It’s a cute dress, but I don’t think either of those cover ups are the right choice."
femalefashionadvice,"I'm ""new"" to wearing skirts and dresses and I need some help
I (24f) have always prefered wearing trousers and jumpsuits to skirts and dresses. But recently I have decided to change my style a little and have bought a few of them.
Thing is, I am in a healthy weigh for my height (64 kg for 167 cm) but I have a pooch and it is noticeable thorugh almost every skirt and dress I bought. My interest in fashion is quite recent so what I want to know is if it is a disaster or not, in terms of aesthetic and taste.
For context, my doctor says that most likely I have a big uterus, so I don't think I would be able to get rid of the pooch"
femalefashionadvice,Yeah I think the quality has really gone down over the years. I got my dress in 2006
femalefashionadvice,Thank you so much! ♥️
femalefashionadvice,How would you style [this](https://imgur.com/a/tSqPEP3) dress? Is it appropriate for first date at a high end restaurant? I have never been on this nice of first date and not sure what to wear.
femalefashionadvice,"Well, I would just wear what you have and shop in Italy. I never wanted to be a stereotype when I was younger and “going to Europe and coming home with a suitcase of shopping” was what my mom’s insufferable rich suburban friends did. Now that I am older and understand basically how much further my money goes in Europe in terms of like $ for style AND quality, I do spend some time acquiring new clothes on my trips"
femalefashionadvice,"I have no idea what to wear! The last time I traveled overseas (I’m in the US), I was 300+ lbs and lived in men’s t-shirts and yoga pants as a size 24/26 because those were the only things I was comfortable in. I’ve lost 135lbs since then and can now dress well as a size 8/10."
femalefashionadvice,You wouldn’t look fussy but not necessarily in-place either
femalefashionadvice,"I’m headed to Italy (Venice, Florence, Rome, and Sorrento) from 2 March to 11 March as part of a tour group. Would I look extremely out-of-place or fussy if I wore dresses and sandals/comfortable low heels? Basically my dresses are vintage reproductions [like this](https://theseamstressofbloomsbury.co.uk/products/mabel-3-4-waterfall-dress?variant=43967876104414)but not pinup style."
femalefashionadvice,"You’re brave for speaking out against the onslaught of angry millennials who don’t want to give up their skinny jeans lol. 

Honestly though I think what’s irritating me about them is that they’re hypocrites as you were implying. Don’t come to a female fashion advice sub and get upset when someone tells you you look outdated. What’s the point of even coming here if you supposedly “don’t care what anyone thinks”?

They keep writing me entire novels defending their positions which imo screams insecurity to me. But idk I guess I’m done caring at this point."
femalefashionadvice,Abercrombie!

I loved the era Where I was searching like mad for statement pieces, But we spend so much of our lives in the every day And I love this era of wardrobe building and looking chic and refined in a good pair of pants!"
femalefashionadvice,Are the Fila Disrupter 2 wedges comfortable?  I have never wanted an athletic shoe so badly.
femalefashionadvice,"Yeah they were trying to bring back flares a while ago when higher rise jeans came in, but nobody was really going for it. I was excited about it because I love the look of flares and bellbottoms but I definitely wasn't in thee majority."
femalefashionadvice,Why the downvotes?
femalefashionadvice,"I haven't liked athletic shoes very much until this year.  I usually wear gems or knee high com at boots.

femalefashionadvice,"Assuming you’re wearing clips, rather than adding buttons to all your trousers, where did you find your suspenders? I’ve been wanting some but I don’t wanna buy something that ends up cheaply made, that I hate!"
femalefashionadvice,"I just wear half socks, they cover the top half of my foot. I don't find I really need protection on the heel area."
femalefashionadvice,"I recently ordered some short sleeve tees from blankstyle.com, they are a wholesaler. Their item description goes into a lot of detail about the weights of the cotton, so you may be able to find something there.  Just a heads up that the tee prices are overall very reasonable, but their shipping is pretty high for small quantities. It still came out to less than what I would have paid for just one tee."
femalefashionadvice,"I do both. For me it’s more about the style (high waisted, high leg, etc.) and what I feel “cool” and comfortable wearing"
femalefashionadvice,"This is amazing- super detailed with tons of examples! I would love to see more posts like this! Please give me advice on how to style crop tops for all body types! I’m someone who’s self-conscious about exposing my stomach since it’s larger than the rest of my body (all gut, no butt)"
femalefashionadvice,Thanks!! I have heard of that and appreciate the suggestion. I think my use case (WFH) is just geared more to everyday jewelry at the moment.
femalefashionadvice,"I bought this [hot pink slip dress by Bebe](https://www.bebe.com/products/satin-cowl-neck-slip-mini-dress-fuchsia) at Nordstrom Rack on a whim. I was too young to wear them in the part of the 90’s when these were in so I was like, ah, what the heck!"

The box didn’t look tampered with, we have cameras so I know no one ripped it open, and worst of all the package weighs exactly the same as the weight listed on the packing slip, so it was never in the box to begin with. I sent them photos of the weight of the box compared to the packing slip and videos of me opening the package and still no response! I almost want to file a police report because of how expensive it was."
femalefashionadvice,Tough one! I think bottom is slightly better.
femalefashionadvice,"Thank you, that's helpful!!"

femalefashionadvice,No lol. I love this post but that part is off. Low rise was out by 2010 or so
femalefashionadvice,So why are you in a fashion sub if you don’t care what’s in style
femalefashionadvice,Can someone please refer me to For Love and Lemons? We would each get 30% off an order which would be hugeee. The webpage for how to do this seems like it isn't working though..

femalefashionadvice,"I'm 40, and mid-rise is what works for me and seems most practical. High and low-rise were doable years ago when I was skinny, but both tend to emphasize the belly now. Why can't they just compromise and stay in the middle? Do I need to start shopping at Talbots?"
femalefashionadvice,Weird. I thought leg opening was the same across sizes for Levis. I have size 11 feet and the size 28s fit me no problem.
femalefashionadvice,"To be perfectly honest? It just made me realize how far I really am away from maintaining a proper overall  ""style."" I thought by 35 I'd be so put together, but my God, I'm just out here winging it, and I long to have my style and clothing feel so, I dunno, ""correct."" I wish I could be put together like the person who made the post probably is."
femalefashionadvice,"For skinny jeans, I've only ever worn them in black and full-length. I strongly believe that they are the only jeans that will never ever go out of style and can be adapted to every trend. But again they are pretty much just thicker leggings."
femalefashionadvice,Wow! The dress is gorgeous. And amazing that you got in on sale.
femalefashionadvice,The worst.  I bought two pairs several years ago; one pair I’ve worn only once and the other I haven’t touched.
femalefashionadvice,"Agree about high-waisted pants, I look pregnant in them. I much prefer mid-rise to camouflage the stomach."
femalefashionadvice,Ohhhh that floral silk dress is gorgeous! Great find! I love L'Agence.
femalefashionadvice,"High rise flares and slim straights! We did still have some decently high volume skinnies, but only in seasonal fabrics like velvet and coated."
femalefashionadvice,And don’t forget the colored denim trend in 2012-2014!
femalefashionadvice,"I do a lot of dressing up events personally/for family stuff, so it’ll be a frequent thing for me in that space for sure. I have [this skirt](https://www.saksfifthavenue.com/product/max-mara-leisure-coimbra-satin-skirt-0400017241075.html) and another blue cowl neck top I intend to do a whole monochromatic thing with it 

But actually I’m most excited to style it down for every day stuff. The mannequin in store had it styled with a similar color of light wash jeans, with this gorgeous chartreuse satin top. Chartreuse makes me look like a river corpse, so I’ll probably go with a different color on top that compliments or a print has blue accents. 

I’ve got a satin camisone I wear rarely in a rust color, for example, or another orange one with blue swirls in the print? I’ll probably go one of those directions."
femalefashionadvice,Cotton overalls like the ones from Lucy &amp; Yak that don't nip in at the waist would be wonderful for this. They are so comfortable and don't compress the waist whatsoever. Also seconding u/FerociousFrizzlyBear suggestion that jumpsuits and rompers would also probably be a welcome comfort to you and there are many options out there in natural materials like cotton and linen.
femalefashionadvice,"Omg yes I absolutely will, have you seen the Lisa Says Gah matching sweaters with dogs???! They don’t make one big enough for my girl, so I’ve gotta figure something else out but so help me, I will have a matching sweater with this dog one day

femalefashionadvice,Obsessed
femalefashionadvice,Democracy jeans aren't the most stylish but the fit has saved my life
femalefashionadvice,That’s a good point and I’ve decided even though I love the new trend I’m going to not over buy. Wear what I have until they wear out or I need to refresh in a new trend.
femalefashionadvice,"Neither of those are formal, no. For work, OK."
femalefashionadvice,You’ll likely find more answers in r/findfashion. I did some searching with “pink off the shoulder wide ribbed asymmetrical hem sweater” and didn’t find anything similar.
femalefashionadvice,Same! Really did not have high hopes and I love them.
femalefashionadvice,"Ehhh I'm super skinny and straight up and down and look good in wide, slouchy, straight-legged etc jeans. Sure, these styles don't emphasize my waist or anything (unless I'm wearing a form-fitting shirt/crop top with low-rise) but that's not the only point of fashion."
femalefashionadvice,"If you are OK with boxy, this [LL Bean tee](https://www.llbean.com/llb/shop/40104?page=beans-tee-long-sleeve-crewneck&amp;bc=12-27-607-504209&amp;feat=504209-GN3&amp;csp=f&amp;pos=2) is opaque in white.

femalefashionadvice,I’m a bit fan of posts with both the company’s and real FFAer’s pics of the same item. Much more realistic.
femalefashionadvice,I found a spotless cream colored knee-length wool/cashmere Ralph Lauren sweater at the thrift store for 17 dollars. It has frog closures and one tiny hole I'm going to fix. I'm so warm and life is good!
femalefashionadvice,It's gorgeous. Where do you wear it?
femalefashionadvice,"Yep, exactly. Low rise is not a good style for those of us with bubble butts and hips."
femalefashionadvice,Mine did! My band size increased by about an inch after pregnancy!
femalefashionadvice,"I must be the only one who is happy to have an alternative to skinny jeans, which are horribly unflattering on me. I’ve been waiting a long time for this moment!"
femalefashionadvice,"I have a similar shape and I love Frame’s Le High Flare. They are so flattering and the fabric has just the right weight and stretch. Pricey, but you can often find them on sale. https://frame-store.com/products/le-high-flare-dublin"

I’m so bad with acronyms. 

Omg PLEASE. Please tag me if you do. I need it in my life. My dog and I are getting matching stuff soon. (Collar and bracelet. Bc we’re bffs)"
femalefashionadvice,"I’m not the original commenter but it bothers me too because there are people literally calling themselves a “fashion disaster” but also won’t take any advice in a fashion sub. So then…why even be here, proudly clutching on to their dated skinny jeans? It just doesn’t make sense"
femalefashionadvice,"I hate that you’re being downvoted so much when you’re right. Styles and trends are always evolving - I’m all for people wearing whatever they’re comfortable with, but when it comes to people like this thread’s OP who says she won’t “give up skinny jeans anytime soon” but then literally calls herself a “fashion disaster”, it’s like??? They’re admitting you dress poorly but also won’t accept any advice. So why even be part of the female fashion sub then 🤦🏻‍♀️ this sub is full of people who don’t give a whit about clothes and fashion."

femalefashionadvice,"this sub is ffa

And right??? It was high up when sorted posts by top of this year lol catch my dog and I in matching outfits there soon"
femalefashionadvice,"I’m fucking dead her ponte pants comments are absolutely hilarious. Idk what they did to her but I’m glad they did cause I got a good laugh out of it 

I’m also not a huge fan of them tbh, largely because they’re often just kinda black and tapered and lack their own structure and that combo on me looks like a wee color-scheme-confused hobbit 

But yeah I think that there’s a lot of misconception about other people’s intentions in the initial post. My friend dresses for frugality, appropriateness, and her own comfort in that order of priority. Her intention in any outfit is never to say she looks trendy or not, (though sometimes she is or isn’t) nor is it to say she is fashionable or not (though sometimes it is or isn’t). While it probably, yes, does show to people who keep track of those things that it is not a priority for her, but isn’t a reflection of a lack of awareness of the passage of time (though that also is a great line). She *just this month* bought straight leg jeans for the first time. 

While certainly clothing and how you dress can and does say something to others, and we can make guesses about others’ intentions from their own clothing, both ways it’s just guesswork. If someone wore white to a wedding I’ve got a good inkling their intention is to be noticed and not caring if it’s in a bad way, but hey, for all I know about that person and their context getting dressed that day (which is nothing beyond being at the same event) that’s the bride’s aunt Susan wearing the bride’s deceased mom’s dress at the bride’s request. The point is: there’s a hundred reasons other than “I look fashionable” to put on different articles in the morning and no assumption or guesswork on the logic is going to be guaranteed. Especially when, for many people, the fashionable-ness or trendy-ness is farther from their mind than it is for many people here. 

I like helping people out on this sub. Styling others and helping them find items and fits and styles that work for them is a delight for me, and though I know this place isn’t very post active… this was an odd one?"
femalefashionadvice,"Check out Extra Petite blog (jeanwang on IG) - she’s 5’0 and wears a lot of wide legged pants and makes it look super chic and lengthening. I’m 5’2 and petite framed myself, and wear a lot of straight/wide leg pants - as long as they’re tailored, these pants can definitely work on smaller people."
femalefashionadvice,"https://preview.redd.it/nv1rhkns4vka1.jpeg?width=1265&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=62a690a91df99c2b22b2f0042eaac3363d7a0d28

Just got these boots from vagabond. They’re the Larks. Hopefully they fit. I have been wanting a spring/fall heeled boot for a while. I have a different pair of vagabond white boots and I’m happy with those, so fingers crossed these fit. I’m at 8/8.5 and they only had whole sizes and suggest sizing up for half. My other vagabond boots are a bit slippy for me due to the size."
femalefashionadvice,In retrospect this also makes me wonder if the shift from low to high rise skinnies over the decade and that big push for jeggings in the early to mid 2010s were largely motivated by the fashion industry begrudgingly accepting the absolute chokehold skinnies had on the market and looking for new ways to sell more of the same jean (since they couldn't push them out after the usual 3-5 yr cycle).
femalefashionadvice,"Can confirm.  Grew up in a preppy old-money New England town.  Rich people wore good quality but old sweaters, khakis, boat shoes.  For dressy occasions, a simple black dress and pearls.  Hair had no particular style; usually just a shoulder length bob type haircut, minimal
styling.  Minimal makeup.  Absolutely nothing trendy, sparkly, and no logos ever.  The clothes would be of high quality but only from obscure brands that only other rich people would know about.  And they’d drive around in an ancient Volvo wagon.  Looking flashy was for the nouveau riche."
femalefashionadvice,IMO it's too soon to get rid of anything yet. Give it six months and donate the ones you haven't worn in that time.
femalefashionadvice,"I hadn't thought of this combo before, but these are two of my favorite colors!"
femalefashionadvice,"I like the J Crew white shirts, and they often have pretty big sales so you should be able to find it in your price range."
femalefashionadvice,I've been very intrigued by Rag &amp; Bone's [Miramar joggers/sweatpants](https://www.nordstrom.com/s/rag-and-bone-rag-bone-miramar-wide-leg-pants/6838686?color=MOONRISE&amp;utm_content=33067519669&amp;utm_term=aud-1024039079033:pla-261054641501&amp;utm_channel=low_nd_shopping_standard&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_campaign=662927188&amp;adpos=&amp;creative=145518898063&amp;device=c&amp;matchtype=&amp;network=g&amp;acctid=21700000001689570&amp;dskeywordid=92700049880577738&amp;lid=92700049880577738&amp;ds_s_kwgid=58700005470160220&amp;ds_s_inventory_feed_id=97700000007631122&amp;dsproductgroupid=261054641501&amp;product_id=37554560&amp;merchid=1243147&amp;prodctry=US&amp;prodlang=en&amp;channel=online&amp;storeid=&amp;locationid=9031303&amp;targetid=aud-1024039079033:pla-261054641501&amp;campaignid=662927188&amp;adgroupid=33067519669&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiAxvGfBhB-EiwAMPakqkrKGQ2dcvaHW7U-zTUPtXZY575FcHBJ7nQH33aMg2Z8-45If7f69hoC7bMQAvD_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds) which have a jeans pattern printed on them. Never tried them or seen them in person so I can't say how realistic they'd look.
femalefashionadvice,"Yes probably but just be aware that certain parts of the jeans may loosen more than others, like I usually find that the legs stretch out more than the waistband."
femalefashionadvice,"I bought a pair of her heels recently that I wanted \*so\* badly. Said they were 3"". They were 4. I have 8"" feet, that inch makes a big damn difference. I was really disappointed."
femalefashionadvice,Idk what ffa means but that post is hysterical haha!! Thank you for linking me. That turtle neck LOL
femalefashionadvice,"I was thinking about this today, wearing a one piece jumper with a belt that could be tied as tight or loose as you want, and I came to the conclusion that it would be perfect for anyone who can't stand tight waistbands for any reason."
femalefashionadvice,I hate how we're moving away from every boy flattering clothes to go to things that just make fat people look fatter lol
femalefashionadvice,"I'm turning 30 this year, so thank you for this. Happy to see I've got some of it right!  Love the different styles/representations in your examples too."
femalefashionadvice,"old navy has great camis, both cropped and full length!"
femalefashionadvice,"Good idea, I got rid of my camis with the lace tops years ago. Can you recommend any brands? Much appreciated."
femalefashionadvice,"The shiny ones are more flexible imo and could be dressed up. I could see these very easily in a casual office environment, but I think they also work with slacks and a blouse, or with dress socks /tights and a skirt or dress. Balance them out at your top with a thicker cardigan or heavier jewelry to make it feel cohesive"
femalefashionadvice,Interesting! Id love to know which podcast.
femalefashionadvice,Why is “the shoes of it all“ the perfect addition to that sentence
femalefashionadvice,"I am in the process of refreshing my wardrobe and so far have purchased [this satin shirt](https://ca.frankandoak.com/products/2110296-533?dfw_tracker=131022-42504274477234&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=18091058589&amp;utm_content=&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiAxvGfBhB-EiwAMPakquF4GpzBF4z1lTekVJZLTly2kFkvHlopfx4TB0IEnQyD_trIliLaABoCcB4QAvD_BwE) from Frank and Oak and [these high-rise skinny jeans](https://duer.ca/collections/womens/products/womens-high-rise-stretch-denim-skinny-black) from DU/ER.

I'm a big fan so far. The shirt is solidly constructed and a very nice colour. I've worn it unbuttoned, hanging straight like a blazer, and also tied at the front with the sleeves rolled. It makes a nice silhouette with both slim pants and a more mom jean/balloon trouser.

The jeans are amazing so far. DU/ER is all about strong stretch materials, so they're very flexible while also being sturdy enough to look like a pant instead of a jegging. I'm planning on going back to grab some of their [high-waisted joggers](https://duer.ca/collections/womens-joggers/products/womens-high-rise-athletic-joggers), as these are some of the first pants I've worn in a while that I don't want to tear off by noon."
femalefashionadvice,I literally gasped in surprise (in a good way) when I opened the ruffle socks link and saw the model has hair in their legs! It's the first time I see that and I'm SO here for it
femalefashionadvice,"I think you'd be fine with those styles. If anything, not having breasts is maybe going to make them sit a bit better :) I'd just order both sizes if you're not sure. 

Personally I like the red-orange better, solely because it's a gorgeous color!"
femalefashionadvice,I decided to give Zara jeans a try recently and I liked them enough to get a 2nd pair.
femalefashionadvice,"Hey everyone! Swimsuit season is creeping up, and I’m curious what people think about mix n match bikinis vs sets? Are mix and match looking outdated? It feels like I’m seeing a lot of sets, but I’m not on Instagram or TikTok so I don’t actually know what people are wearing these days that feels cool"
femalefashionadvice,"Thank you so much for your suggestions, I really appreciate it."
femalefashionadvice,"Warning: I spend a lot. I really like the monk straps from [The Office of Angela Scott](https://theofficeofangelascott.com). Shoe laces and I are not friends. Would I wear the plain leather sole if I stood behind a register all day? No, but I would wear [lug sole](https://theofficeofangelascott.com/products/ms-francoise-black-studded). If I was up &amp; down? Yes. 

I stalk the brand on TheRealReal. Bought a pair of [combat boots](https://www.therealreal.com/products/women/shoes/boots/the-office-of-angela-scott-leather-combat-boots-gfgbc) recently and they are gloriously comfy. 

Brand runs narrowish though some styles are available in wide. Goodyear welted. Have arch supports in most styles. 

For heels, I like slingback kittens that have a flair on the bottom of the heel like [these](https://www.therealreal.com/products/women/shoes/pumps/dolce-gabbana-canvas-animal-print-slingback-pumps-g6ie7). Dolce &amp; Gabbana has a last that fits MY foot. It's really worth finding a last that works with your feet because they tend to be consistent. Btw, slingbacks are more forgiving of size issues but I only buy ones with functional buckles (none of that elastic crap)."
femalefashionadvice,"Your second paragraph was about how older women shouldn’t care what 20-year olds think. My point was that older women are typically not dressing to impress 20-year olds. Even those that truly are dressing to look younger are likely not dressing for the 20-year olds.

Also responding to this 

&gt;	But encouraging women to switch to trendy clothes regardless of their own personal opinion is pressuring them to be young. And the effort is fruitless - by the time older women successfully catch up to the trend, it’s already changed.

I don’t see how you got this from OPs post. Women who are struggling to let go of skinny jeans are likely not the types that try to keep up with micro trends for 20-year olds on social media. Most people just want to look somewhat current to be perceived a certain way by their peers, partners and coworkers. If they had a strong sense of style and felt comfortable in their skinny jeans and booties they would not be visiting this forum at all. For women who come to a fashion advice forum for advice, telling them to listen to their own opinion is not helpful. Providing some simple suggestions to get out of a rut is not at all the same as pressuring women to look young and is also very different from pressures to do Botox and procedures in society at large.

You don’t need a sociology degree to see how the enormous pressures on women to look a certain way is holding us back as a group. However, we all still have to live in this society and it’s not wrong to want to conform enough to avoid the negative consequences of not somewhat keeping up."
femalefashionadvice,That’s really interesting and good to know!
femalefashionadvice,"For me, I’m on the shorter side, and it definitely does not come that low. Enough that it’s a smidge of cleavage, but due to my chest size I’m bound to have cleavage with practically any common necklines lower than a crew neck? I think this would vary a lot with torso length"
femalefashionadvice,Bottom!
femalefashionadvice,"Anyone from Philly or knowledgeable about Philly:

Can you recommend any cute shops or areas to check out for local/unique finds? I’m visiting soon and hoping to check out the local scene. Also accepting food/brewery recs :)"
femalefashionadvice,Gotta love Uniqlo. Thank you!
femalefashionadvice,You could also try ankle zip jeans!
femalefashionadvice,"Is the square neck as low as it looks on the model? I've been looking for a bodysuit that isn't as high as a crew neck (I already have a couple!), but would still be appropriate for a smart-casual office."
femalefashionadvice,"Look I used to get ruthlessly stalked and hit on by the homeless men outside my old apartment in chicago, but the left me alone whenever I wore overalls. I actually later would work with the homeless population, and though I loved my clients they *hated* my overalls? 

So clearly as a general crowd, they’re not wise to fashion, because overalls fuckin slap

Wear the damn hat"
femalefashionadvice,"Please feel free to do more of these! I am embracing the straight leg, but it’s my tops that are suffering. I went through a sleeveless stage over the last few years, and now hate everything paired with my straight leg jeans.

I am also a hesitant layerer lol layers remind me of the tanks over tshirts trend and I hate having so many layers"

femalefashionadvice,"With this I think it’s all styling that makes it not cater-waitery 

Jewelry, makeup, hair, a nice coat, a nice belt, sunglasses, hell even a cute lil neckerchief take basics outfits from functional to chic"
femalefashionadvice,"Oh my gosh these are all gorgeous, thank you so much for taking the time out of your day to help me out!! I'll have to see what my mum and roomie think, they've both got good eyes for this as well. Thank you so so much!!"
femalefashionadvice,SOLD lol. Thank you!!!
femalefashionadvice,"Preach.  The self-pressure to cling to the past, conform, conform, conform, and talk trash about your own body is depressing.  

I was really interested in the original premise, and right now more than 700 people have commented about it, but I really balk at going through 650+ comments that have nothing to add but exclamations of discomfort about clothing oneself."
femalefashionadvice,"Gotcha!

So since you’re taller I’ll use asos since most of their brands are super kind to your height. Typically with grad dresses you want to be certain the hem of the dress is not longer than your gown, and that the color isn’t super obnoxiously visible through the gown (which for black isn’t an issue!). I’ll be checking the height of models to make sure that these won’t be too long that they’ll be below your gown too!

[this is a nice but casual-er leaning option](https://www.asos.com/us/prd/202858515?acquisitionsource=pasteboard). With broader shoulders the vneck will draw the eye away from that feature, plus cute little embroidered flowers, a looser fit to sit in is also super nice since depending on location sometimes it can be super uncomfy for all that time.

[this jacquard option](https://www.asos.com/us/prd/203816224?acquisitionsource=pasteboard) is square neck and a print which both will bring the eye a bit elsewhere, again not a tight fit, and formal without being overly so, but a bit dressier than the prior option, and a bit more colorful without being *bright* and will be pretty unique 

[this black floral wrap dress](https://www.asos.com/us/prd/203185082?acquisitionsource=pasteboard) will be a common style, but again, v neck to draw that eye down and a looser fit will be great for you, but the dark base color with a lighter larger print floral will make it a bit more standout as different 

I know you said you’re thinking midi, but let me hit you with a few shorter styles too, since you said you really dig your long legs

[this might not be a grad vibe but seems up your alley tbh](https://www.asos.com/us/prd/201204401?acquisitionsource=pasteboard) just for the color alone, but that neckline and the flare sleeves will give you that eye elsewhere, highlight your long legs without being too short (since the model is your height)

[this floral flowy mini](https://www.asos.com/us/prd/202695878?acquisitionsource=pasteboard) could work well for both! 

This [large pattern floral](https://www.asos.com/us/prd/203344115?acquisitionsource=pasteboard) would also be a good candidate, add structure to your shoulders that isn’t yours, with a print and neckline making you look elsewhere, in a darker color way with light sections that is pretty multi seasonal. The model is taller than you too, so definitely would still be appropriate"
femalefashionadvice,That's a cool shirt! I could see myself wearing that to work!
femalefashionadvice,Anoukyve is my favorite on Instagram. She dresses super basic but it’s all modern.
femalefashionadvice,Oh I miss Betsey Johnson! I bought one of her dresses at one of her boutiques in the mall once and wore it to my first wedding. It was black lace and strapless with a dark olive slip underneath.
femalefashionadvice,Red and yellow completely have my heart for this spring too! Love the pics of wearing the new pieces.
femalefashionadvice,Just saw this today: https://www.uniqlo.com/us/en/products/E455762-000/00?colorDisplayCode=00&amp;sizeDisplayCode=003
femalefashionadvice,"I think you really need to reread my comment and hold back on the initial upset reaction you had.  

Literally nowhere did I say that older women are dressing to impress younger people or are supposed to be frumpy. It’s a statement about how marking clothes associated with older women as ugly/dated/unfashionable is ageist. If you cannot see at all how the fashion industry or beauty industry fuels a lot of ageist marketing towards women, I encourage you to crack open the huge wealth of sociological research aimed at that exact subject. I have a degree in it now; I would know. 

The fashion industry is obviously not driven by 18 year olds. That’s a ridiculous statement and is a very surface level interpretation of what I said. It is very plainly obvious that many designers are older people. However, if you seriously do not think that younger women are the “ideal” type market for trendier clothing, pick any major clothing manufacturer and look at who the models are in their sample photos. Look at the ages of the models they send down the runway. They’re nearly all younger women. That’s for a reason, and it’s not a good one."
femalefashionadvice,I’m having the same dilemma right now. The relaxed fit is more on trend at the moment but I’m wondering if a straight cut would have more longevity. I’m planning to invest in this one so I want a trench that will last and is timeless. But still not sure.
femalefashionadvice,I understand the frustration! Glad you got it off your chest and have some light at the end of the tunnel! Rooting for you!
femalefashionadvice,I love this skirt but I've never had the chance to bring it out. I'm considering wearing it to a black tie wedding this spring. Would this work for black tie? Any recommendation on what I could pair with it on top? [https://imgur.com/a/hC894uZ](https://imgur.com/a/hC894uZ)
femalefashionadvice,That Tory Burch dress!!! Love it
femalefashionadvice,"Okay I just checked the website, Babaton’s bodysuits do all have snap closures still. Phew

[here](https://www.aritzia.com/us/en/clothing/bodysuits) is the link, just filter by brand to Babaton. 

To rave for a second on why I think they’re perfect: I went from a C to a DD cup in the last year, and these things have not only maintained their shape but I have not needed to phase them out or get a new size (whe’ almost every other top in my closet has betrayed me) and I *still don’t need a bra with them*. I have one each of the muscle, mock neck, crew neck short sleeve, and square neck short sleeve all from the contour line and I seriously love them. They are my perfect basics. When I just can’t figure out how to make an outfit work and have to scrap everything to get out the door? These suckers are there to (literally) support me in my time of need and can be slapped on with anything. Snap closure is stretchy enough to not feel like a freaking yoga pose I can’t do too."
femalefashionadvice,"Thank you so much for the tips! I've never graduated before (didn't have a high school graduation) so I'm excited but also nervous, this is good stuff to know!"
femalefashionadvice,Crossing my fingers for you!
femalefashionadvice,"Mercerizing is a process that gives cotton, rayon, and modal yarns a smoother, more silk-like finish. Fluid weaving refers to using machines that make a more tightly woven fabric."
femalefashionadvice,So I guess those of us with short torsos and/or large ribcages are doomed to be either out of style or look like potatoes 🥲
femalefashionadvice,"Pretty much any cocktail dress could work, so I'd suggest narrowing down what you want a little bit more! Think about the typical weather around that time (and then add ~20*F for that polyester gown on top), think about silhouettes you like, colors that you like to wear and which look good with the color of your gown, fabrics/textures you like, etc. 

My one major suggestion would be to pay attention to the length—most grad gowns are an awkward midi length and having something that sticks out below that can look even weirder IMO, so I would go with something no longer than knee length."
femalefashionadvice,"My grad gown will be black! 

So I've lately really been loving embroidered florals and I think I want to aim for a midi/tea-length dress. I don't want it to be *too* fancy but I still want to make sure I look nice. I like darker colors like black, crimson, plum, and dark teal. I have a fairly average build, 5'7"" with a bit of extra around my stomach/hips/thighs. I think my shoulders are broad for a woman so I like to try and minimize that where I can. I have long legs though so that's a nice feature!

I'm honestly open to a lot of different styles, I'm just not sure what is socially expected for these events. Thank you for the reply!"
femalefashionadvice,"Most of my button ups get hung, and I noticed that when the spin takes out too much water they dry so much more wrinkly - even with some good flapping. 

“Flap with gusto” made me absolutely cackle btw. I’m autistic and now I going to use this to describe my happy hand flapping to my husband 😂💕"
femalefashionadvice,"AlloyApparel.com for affordable 36” inseam jeans; Frame for pricier 35” inseam jeans. Agree that it’s harder to find long inseams lately, though."
femalefashionadvice,Do you know which style exactly? They probably do vary from style to style; the one I have might be Wilfred? Not 100% sure. I'm definitely still open to Aritzia if there are options with crotch snaps!
femalefashionadvice,"I don’t know where people get the idea that fashion is about dressing young. Sure, teens might wear the most out there trends but it’s adults that are creating fashion and adults that have the purchasing power to buy it. Fashion is a trillion dollar industry and is definitely not run by 20 year olds nor is it targeting primarily a teen demographic.

If anything it’s more ageist to assume that older women either dress in outdated frumpy clothes or are trying to impress some 18-year old on TikTok. Turns out, women can be 35, have an interest in fashion and have fun with clothes and still not give two shits about what teens think about them. I don’t at all understand what having an interest in fashion has to do with anti-aging procedures."
femalefashionadvice,Thanks!
femalefashionadvice,"The babaton ones at aritzia have crotch snaps still, yes? I’ll be so sad if they got rid of that about them because the ones in my closet are staples for me, if the babaton still have a crotch snap they’re exactly what you’re looking for"
femalefashionadvice,Thanks for the tip I'll have to modify my system!
femalefashionadvice,God wishful thinking here but I *really* hope denim wise we continue to stick to everything goes. It’s so much better for everyone to be able to work with what they feel fits them well versus a huge cultural dislike for specific styles
femalefashionadvice,"Do you know if your grad gown will be white? If it won’t be, you have a lot more options to play with for what you wear underneath!

Do you have a general style/aesthetic you like? Any aspects of your body to work around/highlight that you’d like to consider? More specificity for the type of stuff you enjoy wearing would be really helpful for working to find you something you would love for both events"
femalefashionadvice,"Adding - if your machine has a setting for spin cycle level, changing it to retain a smidge more water than usual helps. All the things I hang dry I spin on Medium, versus towels or jeans on “high” to get more water out."
femalefashionadvice,"Another men's trouser gal here!  Much older than you, and no doubt a lot shorter.  But I have several pairs of trousers (not jeans, just haven't been at the replacing stage yet) which are men's, they work fine turned up on the outside.  I like proper pockets just for handkerchief, I always carry a bag."
femalefashionadvice,"Yeah. I’m also 34. The resistance to changing trends is odd enough coming from, like, 28 year olds, but I especially don’t understand it coming from my “peak Millennial” peers because *I remember the transition to skinny jeans, and they must too!* I remember so many people whining about how they were “too short” or “too fat” for skinny jeans! And now we’re turning around and saying we’re “too short” or “too fat” for the shapes we once found so flattering that we were reluctant to drop them?? 

Like, I was not an early adopter of the skinnies + volume on top thing because I thought I was too short for the pants and too busty for the tops. In retrospect, that was simply fueled by adolescent body angst. The lesson I took from that experience was not to fear change because my body is what it is, and it will look like what it is no matter what I wear. I won’t look 8 inches taller and 10 lbs lighter by wearing wide legs instead of skinnies or vice versa. And that’s OK! 

I can choose between looking like a short, not model-skinny woman wearing fashionable clothing, or a short, not model-skinny woman wearing not-fashionable clothing. Some days I choose the former. Other days, I choose the latter, but I’m not about to defensively post about my gigantic Eddie Bauer cowl neck sweatshirt and freakin’ Merrells on a *fashion* forum."
femalefashionadvice,"Gotcha, for some reason I mistakenly assumed it was your first time! For family fun, I think your sneakers will be just fine. I haven't been out to Vegas since the pandy and family moving out of that area, but there's such a variety of fashion from very casual to very glam that I don't think you'll stand out in a bad way. You can check out Pinterest for inspiration on fashionable sneaker outfits. You could probably even wear them with your maxi, with or without one of your zip hoodies for a ""pretty"" casual look. Maxi, cardi and sandals would be a step up in formality from that. If I were you, I'd use it as an excuse to go shopping, particularly for up-to-date accessories. Your basic jeans/leggings + graphic tee outfit formula could easily be modernized and spruced up without a big investment. What about some metallic, printed or colorful sneakers, if you can find ones that suit your needs? Or a fun bag (hands-free crossbody or backpack for maximum practicality)!"
femalefashionadvice,Hello! I was hoping to get some advice for keywords and styles to search for. I'm looking for a dress that I can wear to the opening of a student art exhibition featuring my work in April and then to my graduation in May. What sort of dress would be appropriate? All I know is that I don't want white.
femalefashionadvice,"Oooh the sisters seem cool! I already have a pair of boots very similar to the Jetts so I 100% am MV's target audience! I'm so hoping the seller is able to send them to me, if not I'll go back to dreaming ☁️"
femalefashionadvice,"Yup.  Another 60+ here.  Never wore anything ripped/holey/frayed.  Nothing to do with this, but wonder now do I get treated differently because I wear graphic tees!  Quite possibly, and I'm completely oblivious to anything."
femalefashionadvice,"I wore wide leg and straight legs in elementary school, flares and boot cut in middle school, and skinny jeans in high school - university.

Now it’s back to wide leg and straight leg.

So seems like every 3-5 years, the trend changes"
femalefashionadvice,Oop thought I included it! It's [annielesperance](https://www.etsy.com/ca/shop/annielesperance) on Etsy!
femalefashionadvice,"A long time ago, I did this.

I still have the jeans, although I have to say, the crispness now is not to par with my commercially dyed jeans (aka, the ones I bought that came in the original color). I'm too lazy to do it again."
femalefashionadvice,"Right??? Cause of the price I was almost kind of hoping it wouldn’t work, or would seem poorly constructed compared to what it should be, and just kind of expecting not working to be my luck with my shape. It needed to be perfect for that dollar amount. 

But it totally blew me away, so here we are. Is *way* more than I typically would spend on one item but I know I will wear this a LOT"
femalefashionadvice,"Thanks! I knew if I stopped to Google I'd remember the name but it was just escaping me.  I was about to go to the Buckle this weekend bc my local raw denim store has cut their inventory way down and they have like 2 styles for women now. I have looked at madewell but without a store in my state to try some, I'm nervous based on all the pictures making their inseams look short."
femalefashionadvice,"agree! kept a tommy hilfiger denim pencil skirt and a high quality denim jacket from 15 years ago, whipped them out last friday bc they were good quality. there were lots of other fast fashion pieces I let go."
femalefashionadvice,Love both of these!! That first jacket is beautiful
femalefashionadvice,Omg! I totally forget about MV! I used to pine over the Jetts back in the day when the Suarez sisters used to do content for them!
femalefashionadvice,Do you recommend a mid or a low rise? I think I've only tried a high rise so far.
femalefashionadvice,"I have really tiny earlobes so I have to be extra careful about wearing heavy earrings. I do find that earring stickers (they go on the back of your earlobe and you pierce the earring through them) really help take the weight off of my earlobes. For everyday earrings I tend to prefer shopping for lightweight earrings, but for statement earrings it's nice to have the option to own some heavier pairs."
femalefashionadvice,And I never EVER wear a top not tucked.  Even on a really hot (UK) day I am just not comfortable.
femalefashionadvice,If I wore skinnies I would be a blob on a toothpick!
femalefashionadvice,"&gt;I agree with the idea that the 2010s trends were more formal/businessy (business casual was a whole trend in like 2015! Among young people who did not do business!) but I think that’s kind of a historical anomaly since the advent of youth fashion culture

Seriously. Like, I'm surprised that some people are stubbornly clinging to this idea that skin-tight, stretchy denim is somehow more professional and ""put-together"" looking than a classic straight leg, lol. No, we were just convinced of that for that particular 10-year period in the 2010s and most of us have since come to our senses."
femalefashionadvice,These are so cute! I especially love the first one. Could you tell me which Etsy store you bought them from? :)
femalefashionadvice,"Great post squeeg! 

It's unfortunate that so many people took this opportunity to write horribly unkind things about their own bodies without considering that other people could have the same features and read their comments!"
femalefashionadvice,"As someone with short legs and muscular calves, this is the single most unflattering style for me."

femalefashionadvice,"I don't think it's only as a result of bad posture, I just mean that when you sit vs.  stand clothing will pull differently!"
femalefashionadvice,"Thank you! I hate seeing comments like ""[insert trend/clothing item] is unflattering on me"" because what about people with similar body types who might read that and then think they *also* can't pull off that trend/clothing item? Comments like this  inadvertently body-shame other people and it's not cool."
femalefashionadvice,"I'm gonna put it out there that if those brands are considered expensive, they might also be cutting costs and making cheaper products. 

I was abroad once and thought I'd take advantage and buy some cheap Levi's but they were so much thinner than the ones at home. Might be worth going in and checking the thickness of the material or at least check composition to see which ones have a higher percentage of cotton."
femalefashionadvice,"I also very much enjoy Sessun! I think Sessun is also near impossible to get here in the US though without like insane shipping =(

The French have higher standards though in just about everything. The food was also... I ate all day long and then lost weight .\_."
femalefashionadvice,"OP didn’t say ankle boots are out, they said that the trendy version of an ankle boot now looks different - just like how the trendy cut of jeans is different."
femalefashionadvice,"Yes, I would only do it in a top load washer. Clothes need to be mostly cotton, and they’ll need room to move around to be dyed evenly. If you’re doing multiple colors, start with the lightest first. When you’re done and you’ve cleaned your washing machine, don’t wash anything too important right away."
femalefashionadvice,"Ballet flats are coming back in so you might be able to hang on to those! Right now the trend is to pair ballet flats with flares/bootcut or baggy low-rise jeans. I like to wear mine with straight-leg or bootcut jeans. 

Other shoe trends that have been big for the past few years: chunky loafers, mid-shaft boots with chunky soles (sometimes called ""lug sole""), New Balance sneakers (right now 550s are huge). But you don't have to completely adhere to shoe trends to not look dated. I still wear the same Chelsea boots I bought in 2018, but pair them with bootcut and straight jeans. I also wear platform Converse high-tops a lot, even though they peaked in trendiness a few years ago."
femalefashionadvice,Looks like a bolero to me!
femalefashionadvice,"Oh yeah, I’m sorry they’re not available over there!"
femalefashionadvice,"It's quite hit and miss. Pure cotton is the only fibre that gives reliable results. Other fibres don't always take up the full shade. Stitching, zips, trim, etc will take up the dye differently. On used clothing, wear spots and invisible stains will take it up differently too. Partial dye methods such as tie dye will disguise some of these issues.

If you're looking for a precise result I would give it a miss - you need to be very open minded and at worst happy to lose the garment completely."
femalefashionadvice,"Damn, this confirms my desire to *not* get pregnant because my knee joints and ligaments  are already too loose!! It's cool, but kinda scary how hormones can change your body."
femalefashionadvice,"Not OP.  It would be nice if there were juniors sizes in the UK!  Closest thing is men's I guess, I have a couple of pairs of men's trousers which fit very well."
femalefashionadvice,"My posture's not that great so that's a good point. I'll have to try out the different fits, maybe they'd work better for me. Thanks!"
femalefashionadvice,"Bought this [Ersa Fibers linen eclipse top](https://www.ersafibers.com/shop/the-eclipse-crop-top-in-neutral) just now. Total impulse purchase because it was on sale. I really wanted the one that's in black and white but it's just too expensive for me to justify buying. Anyway, I do like the colors of the one I got."
femalefashionadvice,"UK here.  Some of our charity shops steam clothes before they go on sale.  The steamer looks sort of like a canister vacuum, except it blows steam instead of sucking dirt!"
femalefashionadvice,I should have posted a fully formed question/thought! 💜
femalefashionadvice,"&gt; You know those pants with the pointy hips horseback riders wear?

Jodhpurs!

And yes a lot of these jeans do that to me as well, but keep on searching. There are some fits out there that work. Try LOFT. Or go to Nordstrom Rack and try on every single pair of jeans in the store (that's what I did)."
femalefashionadvice,IT SUCKS hahaha. I hope one day to find the perfect pair. Mother comes close!
femalefashionadvice,"Man, you said it. I swear to god this sub has virtually nothing to do with fashion anymore. All these girls just want to dress the same as ever and then be validated. Fashion is about changing and evolving and following how trends move in and out. 
 
Well said about the moral obligation too. It’s ok not to care about fashion! But if you’re going to bitch about fashion content then you are Not In The Right Place. This sub frequently doesn’t understand this at all. Fashion =/= personal style. The bitchiness and how people are being suuuuuch bad sports about even considering new trends is so fucking tedious, for sure. 

And yeah, all this “I’m a mom, I can’t wear that, I’m just going to stick with tunics” - please stop."
femalefashionadvice,Disclaimer that I havent actually looked but try Call It Spring lol
femalefashionadvice,Yeah if your office is jeans friendly they’d work. If you have to wear slacks/pants or a dress probably not.
femalefashionadvice,Those are cute as hell.
femalefashionadvice,The tanks I have in a similar style are also a smidge sheer in white. I wear a camisole underneath. Would that be an option?
femalefashionadvice,"Refreshing my wardrobe for spring

\- Tory Burch Eleanor Dress in [Red](https://www.toryburch.com/en-us/clothing/dresses/cotton-poplin-eleanor-dress/138965.html?) ([wearing](https://i.imgur.com/zGDmBK7.jpg)) and [Yellow](https://www.toryburch.com/en-us/clothing/dresses/eleanor-cotton-poplin-dress/86256.html?) from the real real. Love this dress, feels very chic. Could easily see myself wearing in the fall with a turtleneck and boots and in spring with sandals.

\- Co. [cashmere vest](https://www.net-a-porter.com/en-us/shop/product/co/clothing/v-neck/cashmere-sweater-vest/43769801095283396) from the real real. Very oversized, not sure the v neck works on me. Will likely return. 

\- [Flattered](https://www.flattered.com/us/all-shoes-/heels/juno-leather-cognac) sandals. Love how simple and classic these look. 

\- [Maje](https://i.imgur.com/8XYKBpD.jpg) slouchy suit. Feel very cool girl in this. Trying to find the right pair of loafers, I don't think the gold works.

\- Margaret O'Leary wave sweater in [red](https://www.margaretoleary.com/products/marcella-wavy-stripe-pullover?) ([wearing](https://i.imgur.com/tSIc0kY.jpg)). Their stuff never looks that good on the models on their site. Going in to the store and seeing the stuff in person is way better. 

\- [Vince](https://www.vince.com/product/paneled-slip-skirt-V823630772.html) orange paneled skirt purchased on sale. Vince isn't really my style, but I think this skirt is really elegant and pretty."
femalefashionadvice,"Yes, it's been a long while since I've worn 100% cotton jeans - probably like... ever lol! My husband wears Levi's and \*loves\* them, but I never really tried them for me. I fell in love with American Eagle jeans on my body, but am definitely looking to expand a bit. Thank you SO much for the suggestions. I'm definitely going to try the jeans out that you recommended!"
femalefashionadvice,"Following up on my Madewell credit [earrings](https://reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/10va5t7/_/j7gbmxf/?context=1). They were too heavy :( I know it’s possible to acclimate to heavy earrings but I kinda hated the feeling so, the search for something to use the credit on rolls on."
femalefashionadvice,"I remember hearing a podcast episode say that skinny jeans were in for an unprecedented decade or so (late 2000s through 2020) which drove denim manufacturers crazy. 

I feel like we are kinda in a “anything goes” time. I think good-fitting straight and flare jeans will be around for another 2-3 years at least."
femalefashionadvice,Aha!  Maybe if I just wait a bit I can be in fashion again 😈
femalefashionadvice,"Well, no one knows where you are. But personally my jeans are mostly from American Eagle, with a few odd Levi's and Winners off brands."

I was like: omg this is sooo much fabric and impractical as someone who doesn't wear heels and I'll have to have them hemmed  so I put them back. Couldn't get them out of my head, went back, tried a size down, the angels sung and I walked out with them. Still need hemming but very excited to wear them. 


For the Levi's, if you haven't worn 100% cotton jeans in recent memory, there's a breaking in period to be expected. Funny how I won't do that for shoes (sorry, must be comfy out if the box!)  but will for jeans. 🤷‍♀️ The Levi's premium denim is great imo."
femalefashionadvice,Good advice on the cropped suggestion. Thank you. This subreddit is amazing.
femalefashionadvice,"How often do fashion trends cycle? For example, now that the straight leg and flare jeans are in, how many years are they going to be in style? Trying to see if it’s worth the investment. Historically how cyclical are trends like Jean cut/style."
femalefashionadvice,Thank you! I’ll try a slim cut crop top and see if the proportions make more sense then. Appreciate your advice.
femalefashionadvice,"Has anybody ever used their washing machine to dye old clothing? I’m in the process of solidifying my wardrobe color palette and have made lists of clothes I’d like to dye black or red, so the colors and flattering and are easy to mix and match. 

I wouldn’t mind if a midtone blue is dyed black and turns into a navy blue or if a white top turned into a pink top when I am trying to dye it red, as long as the color was crisp and even. 

Any tips/tricks/Hacks/feedback On your own dying journey that might be helpful?"
femalefashionadvice,Thank you! For some reason the pairs I have make me feel like I look like I’m wearing a baggy diaper 😂

femalefashionadvice,"Put in an offer on a secondhand pair of [these boots](https://www.modernvice.com/products/the-original-bolt-1?variant=46445846280) in my colour and size that I've been looking at since pre-pandemic. The seller is inactive and I could only make an offer, so hopefully she comes online and accepts it! Can't justify it at new prices but secondhand would be perfect."
femalefashionadvice,"Yeah I’d stick with a skirt about them and omg yeah ruching can be SO particular. I find the only brand that consistently does ruched items that work well for hourglass figures is Club Monaco, and they usually only have one a season, if that, but the two I have are *excellent* and are staples for me for date night stuff.

I should’ve clarified, shy away from a line dresses unless it is just the skirt that is a line from the waist down, cause yeah, wonky measurements. But A line and drapey skirts work SUPER well, ya buy for your waist and to get them over your hips and as long as you’ve got those down pat you are golden. 

For short skirts things I recently discovered [these](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09G6K6ZGR?ref=ppx_pop_mob_ap_share) which I decided to give a try for cheap in order to see if I could make the style work (plus a SKORT? Yes please) and omg they’re stretchy and cute and absolutely marvelous. [these denim ones](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09ZPMX6K3?ref=ppx_pop_mob_ap_share) are pretty much the same thing, and equally as fantastic. Fit perfectly and comfy and [look fantastic](https://i.imgur.com/CUrBhIF.jpg)

From that photo actually you can see how significant of a difference actually elongating items makes. I’m 5’3” but tall heeled boots + dark tights with a short hemline make my legs look much longer and [me much taller](https://i.imgur.com/mYirYgJ.jpg)

[here](https://i.imgur.com/8JYM2RR.jpg) is in the aym dress, sized up to a L for my boobs, works like a dream

Oh and avoid mid-calf boots with skirts and dresses unless covering the horizontal line they create because it breaks up your leg vertical line in a way that smushes it (unless under jeans/pants, which is what I do with the tabi boots). Right at ankle or tall is better by a long shot for our proportions"
femalefashionadvice,I have a shirt like this from years ago and it's amazing. Love this fabric texture!
femalefashionadvice,"I have been really trying my things on and getting rid of things that don’t work. So when I  went to the outlet mall yesterday I actually had a better sense of what I have and what I wanted. I had a great time revisiting the old 90s -2000s brands and got :

And a pair of khaki pleated waist, tapered. chinos from Tommy Hilfiger. 

A lot of unflattering but, I think, cool clothes here that I’m excited to play with. With a focus on pants because I gained some… assets (weight) and I’m tired of getting acid reflux every time I sit bc my pants are digging into my tummy."
femalefashionadvice,"I mean, I’d come up to about those models’ collarbones, but that doesn’t mean I couldn’t wear iterations of the looks I linked. I’m short and I’ll always be short, but that doesn’t mean I can’t wear wide legged pants, a fitted shirt, and an oversized blazer! I would just have to find versions of the items in my size with similar proportions on my body.

It’s not about replicating a look. It’s about taking inspiration and applying what you like. No outfit will make me look like a 5’11” size 2 model because I’m NOT a 5’11 size 2 model. That doesn’t mean what looks good on them would categorically look bad on me (or on you)!"
femalefashionadvice,I love it! Thanks

femalefashionadvice,"Essentially, it will a bit but I expect it will be not as significantly as you may be thinking. A lot of these tops and their stretchy material are very much better if you have a smaller chest size, and you can see they form fit around the boob and are tauter there than the rest of the looseness. I would, if possible, find a reseller of these who can take the front chest measurement of the garment pit-to-pit for you for a size medium or a size small, and you can figure it out from there!"
femalefashionadvice,I’d like to buy a trench coat for spring and can’t decide between a relaxed fit or straight cut. I’ve been really into more voluminous silhouettes like wide leg tailored trousers and oversized blazers. I’m wondering if the straight cut might balance this out vs adding more volume. Is the relaxed fit more on trend?
femalefashionadvice,I’ve never been to a barn wedding but i feel like this and cowboys boots would be so cute.
femalefashionadvice,"For dresses check out Old Navy. The fitted rib knit midi dresses are super flattering, I'm not sure what the magic is, but totally hides the belly."
femalefashionadvice,"Favorite basic bodysuits for layering? 

I’ve been finding myself wanting a base layer, especially for under sweaters this winter, and I’ve found I’m really craving bodysuits as they’re not fussy and stay in place well. I have one from Aritzia, but it doesn’t have crotch snaps and I just never wear it because of that. Ideally I’d like something like this:

- comes in multiple colors
- crotch snaps (non-negotiable)
- bra-friendly
- soft, comfy fabric (bonus points for double layered and/or smoothing)
- cheap enough to buy multiples (ideally no more than $50 each)

Thanks in advance!"
femalefashionadvice,"Boobs have been out for about 10 years so it's nothing new.  ""Fashion tits"" and wider hips is still in. 


It's really body types that go in and out of style which is messed up. Having said that, I'm grateful that many GenZ are going: screw this, good luck guessing what I look like precisely under here and wearing what they want regardless of how slimming it is. There's more to life than worrying about looking thinner than we are. 


To your problem, I found updating my bras to unlined/seamed ones with a more natural shape, instead of regular or minimizer bras with some projection, has helped deemphasized my chest but I wear 34G which isn't too bad. Combined with a short waist and narrow shoulders tho, I am mostly boobs up top. 


Changing my bras has helped with the silhouette change and made boxy crop tops and voluminous tops work. There's no helping the oversized blazer for me, between a shirt waist and narrow shoulders, I have yet to find one that hits the right oversized notes without swimming in it."
femalefashionadvice,"I'm shopping for comfy sneakers for a Vegas trip. I'm treating myself. Which would you choose? I think the top ones are a bit cuter but they are nylon. The bottom ones are leather.

femalefashionadvice,"Oh my god! First of all thank you for taking that much of an effort. Your tips and recommendations here are golden. 😭❤️ 
I’m living for loose bottoms and tighter tops for as long as I can remember. It just enhances my shape so well. 

But I’m mid way about A-line dresses, never tried a skirt. I had recently got bust ruched and thigh high slit A-line dress. Something about it was really off and made me look like an expectant woman . My off proportions surely are to be blamed. 

I’ve tried Satin dresses and they also seemed to work for me. I guess body hugging dresses enhance my shape more. Will surely give short skirts a fair shot. 

Not really shy of the arms anymore because I’m a huge fan of off shoulders and various cut length tops. 

Thank you again. 😭❤️"
femalefashionadvice,Thanks for the link! Not sure why I was downvoted for hating my ankles.
femalefashionadvice,"Ok, my comment was a classic example of ""when you have a hammer everything looks like a nail"" then. Regardless I'm glad I can shop with em! Would hate for the clothes to fit so well and have a moral reckoning every time I reach for something from there in my closet 😂"
femalefashionadvice,"My ribcage, shoulders and feet all got wider while pregnant. 1 yr postpartum they are still bigger. It's been true for most people in my due date group!"
femalefashionadvice,I saw a pair of Sandro boots on sale and want to purchase it but am unsure about the quality of their shoes. Does anyone have any experience with their shoes?
femalefashionadvice,"It’s meh imo. I bought a few dresses and they were delivered last week and they’re okay? A bit overpriced for cotton dresses; I’ll keep them but I’m not ecstatic with the quality or the fit. The styles/cuts are cute but the fabric is quite thin. They’re certainly wearable but I feel like there are better options out there in the $2-400 range. It was very reminiscent of Realisation, like a homestead version where the photography and styling are great but the pieces themselves are underwhelming, even a bit chintzy."
femalefashionadvice,"I used to watch a lot of SVU as well, and I totally agree. You can make subtle changes to have a more current styling without having to change your whole uniform and silhouette if you’ve already found what works for you. I do think that OP had some good suggestions for some of those things like how to maintain the loose on top + tight on bottom silhouette if that’s still your thing, but some of her quips just fell flat for me. One of my older girl friends absolutely loves that Rae Dunn “Live, Laugh, Love” shit, but she owns it and is a VP of a company and has confidence in droves. I aspire to be her in my 40s, and it’s like “Where is the fashion advice to look like a bad-ass middle-aged boss lady?” It makes sense for someone in their teens and 20s to look up to Bella Hadid or Zendaya (sorry if these references are wrong, I don’t know what young people like), but as a person in her late 30s, I want to look up to someone who is older than me, not younger. I’m not afraid of looking “dated,” but rather, like I don’t have my shit together."
femalefashionadvice,"Depends on the formality and culture of your office. I work in a nonprofit office, and absolutely these would be fine for my work. Hell I have a similar pair lol

Teaching I expect also would find these to be super fine"
femalefashionadvice,"Where can I buy good quality baby tees. The shape of baby tees look very good on me, but the shirts I find tend to be lower quality. I prefer to spend a little more on shirts that will last a little longer."

femalefashionadvice,"The styling (pairings and accessories) looks really good  as inspiration, but I know for sure I can’t replicate the look:

“Model is 180cm/ 5’11” and is wearing a size 27”

But I’m ok with that, I very much enjoy fashion as art these days."
femalefashionadvice,"I really can’t understand it. In 2003, I thought my mom’s 1990 jeans were outdated. Now it’s 2023, and the new moms can’t see why their jeans from 2010 could possibly be outdated. Like babes, it’s been 13 years. Of course they look dated. I’m almost 34, so I’m not being ageist here - I am firmly among the millennial ilk. I love wide leg styles (and have for years), but I don’t make my pants preferences a personality trait, nor do I take skinny jeans as a personal affront do my identity. They’re pants. It’s fine if you want to keep wearing skinny jeans. Really, no one gives a shit what you put on your legs. But getting angry when someone points out they’re dated ain’t it."
femalefashionadvice,"They were always about the quality and the fit, even when their vibe and mission were seriously deranged. Mike Jeffries was the craziest stickler for quality, for handfeel, for getting the color just so.

Thoughts on these shoes? Are they appropriate for formal settings? I've been wanting one for awhile and I'm wondering if they're appropriate for work🤔"
femalefashionadvice,"Hello hello twin lil friend

I am also on the edge of petite height wise, and mid sized because of my hourglass shape causing some bonkers proportions but much of the advice not working for me because I carry very little in my waist/stomach

So I find defining the waist to be key to making skirts and dresses work. A line and drapey things with *vertical* interest are awesome, but I’ve lately been drawn to short skirts that fit at the waist, stop at or above mid thigh, paired with tights and coordinating pointed toe shoes to elongate the leg away from looking hobbity (I often feel hobbitty, which though I love their aesthetic it just isn’t my vibe when everyone in my life is taller than me). 

My “flat” shoes that aren’t pointed toe, are also all chunky or “flatforms”, adding length to my proportions

I have found that moderate-to-conservative cut fitted tops combined with looser bottoms looks AWESOME because it highlights the bust and waist, and looser bottoms help elongate and are also easier to find a correct fit for since you can typically not have to worry about your hip measurement for looser garments. 

Looser dresses are totally an option too! Yet because of my bust I pretty much always highlight the waist with a belt, without this my boobs gape out the fabric and hide my favorite feature (my waist) and overalls just make me feel like a walking event tent 

Tighter garments for spicier outfits also tooootally an option. But it is finicky, I’m a huge fan of Aym Studio, I’ve got two dresses from them, (Hyde being my fave) and the corset back makes it super adjustable. I sized up to fit my boobs and hips, and the corset does the rest for me. Don’t even need a bra despite being DD"
femalefashionadvice,I just did the same thing. But mine are now “stovepipe”
femalefashionadvice,"My 80 year old mom wears her wide-leg Lee jeans with her white New Balances, and a tucked in looser top (like shown in the OP's examples) or turtleneck, then with a shacket over it. She has ALL the shackets-- no tunics in her closet! Flannel shackets. Plaid shackets. Suede shackets. Glittery fancy shackets.

My mom has been wearing this uniform for the past 30 years. She's more on trend now than I am. 

And yeah her GenZ grandchild has been the beneficiary of many of her hand-me-downs."
femalefashionadvice,Looking for casual wide strap tanks that are not so see through. I have these: [https://www.nordstrom.com/s/caslon-muscle-tank/6485080](https://www.nordstrom.com/s/caslon-muscle-tank/6485080) in multiple colors. I absolutely love these tanks since they fit me so well and the straps cover my bra straps. The problem is they are slightly sheer in the lighter colors. I have tried tanks from Banana Republic and Gap but all the tanks I have tried are not wide enough across my chest so my bra was peaking out. I am in the US and would ideally like to spend less than $50 a top but that's not a hard figure since I live in a very hot area and tanks are going to be a mainstay soon. Thanks
femalefashionadvice,"You can do a platform with a really low heel, something not too high but that adds interest. There's also really cute platform Arizona Birkenstocks but sadly, they only come in normal/narrow and not the wide/normal that works best for me."

femalefashionadvice,"As a late 20’s person, who grew up after the heroin chic era, I think there’s a disconnect in what we see as a “cool body.” A lot of the complaint comments here are about how these outfits don’t make us look skinnier, but that’s not the aim."
femalefashionadvice,It drives home the fact that falls from grace can be really helpful. I found some old Abercrombie stuff from like '05 in my mom's closet and the quality now is much higher. Almost like they learned and actually want to deliver on their fit/style (and mission) intentions. I could be wrong but my guess is this might not be the case if not for all the \~stuff\~ that happened with them in the past decade.

Scroll through to see many sneakers and loafers with socks. There's also a highlight all about socks."
femalefashionadvice,Ooooo!! Thank you so much for the suggestions! I will definitely look into that! I know Amazon does the try-before-you-buy and I think a lot of their Levi's are on there. I'll have to check. Can you link the wide leg jeans from Gap? I do like shopping there!
femalefashionadvice,"Agreed with all points, and I just wanted to say that my point about “wear whatever” was more about how your age can affect how you receive that message because there is more pressure to maintain an image. I’m glad that mask-wearing is still a thing in my area because the anonymity is more empowering to wearing whatever than any amount of therapy I’ve had."
femalefashionadvice,"I see, thanks!"
femalefashionadvice,"Perhaps try a bootcut or flare? It's a nice segue as the jeans still fit like skinnies from the waist to the knee, then flare out a little or a lot. 

Otherwise the trick with wide leg is to have them tailored, i.e., take out some of the excess volume. Pre-skinny era, I had to do this all the time with dress slacks.  

I am also finding that the cropped length for wides works better than full length -- adds some structure back in, when your ankle is exposed. 

Or, just find yourself a pair of straights that happen to be on the wider side of straight! I have a pair like that and they are indeed labeled ""straight"" but on me they look more on the wide side."
femalefashionadvice,"Thank you! I think I will try this approach. I know my opinions aren’t popular here, so I really appreciate the advice."
femalefashionadvice,"Huh, it’s probably just a body shape thing then. I don’t find the zipper curves if I get the right size (slightly smaller to accommodate stretching). 

With the button fly, as soon as I sit down for 5 mins then stand up, it just doesn’t hold anything in from the side. I’m honestly not sure why because I agree with you that it seems like that shouldn’t happen, haha. Maybe it’s just the front “smoothing pockets” each brand uses or something."
femalefashionadvice,"Where can I get a plain, white, non-transparent, long-sleeve, tshirt (you'd be surprised how difficult of a time I'm having finding something so simple)?"
femalefashionadvice,"100% appropriate, sounds perfect!"
femalefashionadvice,That's super cute and so well done!
femalefashionadvice,"I have a similar build to you and obvi everyone carries their weight differently, but I would consider your weight + height to be very skinny. For me/my build, I found a small tight shirt paired with the oversized pants works really well. A boxy top plus big pants swallowed me a bit"
femalefashionadvice,"I don’t know which size category do I fall into. I’m bigger for petite size group and effectively leaner for mid size. Hourglass-ish shape and heavy arms and chest. 

I’ve stuck to jeans/trousers/jeggings/track pants as safe outfit options. But would like to wear skirts and dresses for a change. Which shape of dress/skirt would be flattering for just any body type??"
femalefashionadvice,I wear a pair of 8 eye Solovairs to work most days.
femalefashionadvice,"Really can't win for losing anyway: at 57 if I was to wear a head-to-toe 2023 GenZ outfit-- even if it fit and flattered me -- I'd get told I'm trying too hard, or I'm mutton dressed as a lamb."
femalefashionadvice,Oo I love that pair!
femalefashionadvice,"Fellow Canadian here! I will never give up my grandma cardigans. I’ve been wearing these kinds of cardis forever, even in the early 2000s when I only wore flares and cargo pants. So I’ve just returned to my former self — I’ve been wearing my long, chunky cardigans with fitted crop tops and high-waisted, wide-leg pants or barrel-leg pants. You can also try form-fitting tops tucked into those same pant silhouettes and throw the cardi over that, if you’re not into crop tops."
femalefashionadvice,Fellow tall and AE has been my go-to for years and years and years 👍🏻
femalefashionadvice,"I’ve only tried some of these brands, but: all Gap jeans I’ve tried have been very disappointing. I’ve had more success with Old Navy, although their online sizing info is not very accurate. I’ve only tried a couple H&amp;M pairs but they’ve been much higher quality than I expected."
femalefashionadvice,"I'm a huge Law &amp; Order SVU fan, and I frequently binge-watch all the old episodes. It's interesting to see how Mariska's style on the show has changed over the years. She's always pretty much in a basic uniform of suit jacket, trousers, and a V-neck sweater or shell top. But the devil is in the details and as you watch the episodes you can see that the pants rise has changed, the leg shape has changed, and the suit jacket has also evolved and morphed from shorter and fitted to longer and looser with the passing trends. It's subtle but it's there. Go watch some of the earliest episodes and check it out. 

So basically I've taken a lot of cues from that myself, especially when I was working. You wouldn't say Mariska's character is trendy, but yes her outfits are on trend. And I think that is the goal, professionally. 

(Her hair has changed over the years as well, but I always preferred it short like in the first season-- I think the longer hair makes her neck look too short)."
femalefashionadvice,"I just wear what I want and feel comfortable in. I'm 51 and don't care what's in style. If I think it's cute, I wear it."

Help with wedding guest outfit
In 2 weeks I will be attending as a maid of honor at my brother in law's wedding. The ceremony will be in the morning, with only close family present, at the city hall. They decided on this just a month ago, and they are keeping it very unpretentious on purpose, but we will be having lunch at a 1star Micheline restaurant here in Florence afterwards (been there before and it's super fancy, but it will be daytime and usually locals don't dress up that much). Bride will be very casual (think white blazer and trousers), and I would like a polished outfit that doesn't overpower hers but still looks fashionable and effortless! Also, I want to be warm. Help?"
femalefashionadvice,"The introduction and the conclusion of the post was where I really thought the language skewed negative and a little shamey, since the conclusion especially follows this “don’t be like those other women” theme. I also did say I’m probably overthinking it; language aside the actual descriptions of the trends and how to style them are informative. I just got kind of sad reading some replies from women who seemed to feel nervous that they needed to switch their style to be cool or updated or fun, and that they didn’t like how those trends looked on them and wished stuff that they liked was current. 

I also will say I’ve seen this kind of stress reflected in my own mother, and it does break my heart a little when she expresses negative sentiments about not feeling young enough to be cool or pretty or in the know anymore. She is beautiful and cool and interesting to me regardless of what she wears. I really hope that my post has not personally offended people; I’m just trying to say that you shouldn’t change yourself because of an external pressure and not an internal desire."
femalefashionadvice,"Yes ribcage! During pregnancy the diaphragm gets pushed up and ribs pushed out. So whole chest is wider. And at least for me with short torso, it really pushed things out and it's stayed that way. I weigh less than pre-preg but my bra band is bigger. I tried on my old 32 bands and felt like I was being suffocated and couldn't expand my chest. I'm 5 years post partum."
femalefashionadvice,"Something that might help is perusing high-end sites like Net-A-Porter. Since they are so expensive, their target audience is older. They style the clothes in their photos and editorial guides in a more polished and less edgy way than the social media/off-duty model/youth culture pics while still keeping it fresh.

Like, are you gonna buy a pair of $[1250 silk straight leg pants](https://www.net-a-porter.com/en-us/shop/product/brioni/clothing/straight-leg/silk-canvas-straight-leg-pants/1647597294416645)? 
No, probably not (but if you are, more power to you!). But when you look at the way the model is styled, you can take away some ideas that could be applied to update your look at your budget. For instance, in the above case, I notice the close cut of the top, the square toe on the loafers, the chunkiness of the necklace (relative to the delicate chains of a few years ago), and the silhouette of the bag. Or, [look at these kick flares.](https://www.net-a-porter.com/en-us/shop/product/high-sport/clothing/flared/kick-stretch-cotton-flared-pants/1647597304200851) They combine an on-trend pant with a classic shirt for a look that’s friendly to multiple ages and body types. 
Similarly, [these wide-leg jeans](https://www.net-a-porter.com/en-us/shop/product/khaite/clothing/straight-leg/preen-high-rise-wide-leg-pants/46376663162769736), paired with an oversized blazer and a chunky belt, would look clean and kempt on lots of people of different shapes and ages."
femalefashionadvice,I knew one foot was bigger! Maybe I should measure mine to check and see what size I should get.
femalefashionadvice,This post was both extremely helpful (thank you!) and made me extremely depressed (no thank you!).
femalefashionadvice,This is great! Any millennials want to share Instagrams they follow for casual current outfit inspo? I find the visuals so helpful.
femalefashionadvice,"Back in the beginning of December, I took advantage of Corset Story's 4 for 1 multibuy deal, and I just received my package last week - pretty delayed ship time but I did select some pre-order items that made it take longer than it needed to. I selected these:  

- [Black satin waspie belt](https://corset-story.com/products/black-satin-waspie-belt)

- [Lepel Alex black plunge bra](https://corset-story.com/products/pour-moi-alex-padded-plunge-bra-black)

- [Lace crop top](https://corset-story.com/products/ada-black-lace-cropped-top-with-deep-v-neckline)

- [Lace and mesh underbust corset](https://corset-story.com/products/black-lingerie-weight-mesh-underbust-corset)

I haven't worn the corset or belt yet, but I have worn the lace top and the bra together for the ren fair, [as shown here.](https://i.imgur.com/rBh15es.jpg) I was initially surprised that the lace top wasn't lined since it really looked it from the product images, but I like it more that way anyway. It's the perfect pairing for the bra and looks rather intentional. The corsets feel very sturdy, but I definitely need some help lacing them so for the time being I enlisted my SO for help. 

I see them going really well with some dresses I have and poking out under jeans and trousers with a turtleneck for everyday wear.

Unfortunately,  the waspie belt was too small, but that's my fault - I ordered the US 6 instead of US 8 (my recommended size) because it was out of stock and the gamble did not pay off. Thankfully, there's free returns and exchanges."
femalefashionadvice,"I guess I didn't pick up on any of that in the original post.  It seemed like OP was stressing that no one *has* to make any of these switches - it's just for those who are looking for it.  They also stressed in their post that the point isn't to look younger.  It didn't read as ageist to me, but to each their own!  I totally agree with you about those trends in the broader culture, though."
femalefashionadvice,"The first run was in the late aughts, when low rises were king, so nearly all styles of skinnies were low rise."
femalefashionadvice,Get yourself a travel steamer. Many options on Amazon
femalefashionadvice,"reposting one more time in case anyone has other advice 

crossposting from mfa, I’m amab, the only experience I have with women’s clothing is skirts and a couple looser tops, I’m looking these two Lemaire tops, this is probably a stupid question but, I’m a very skinny size US S/sometimes XS, same height as the models, is not having breasts going to affect how the top block fits? Like will the chest look funky on me?

Ssense CS recommended a small for me based on chest size but eyeballing measurements I feel like a M would be safer?

[also any takes on which you prefer are appreciated, I’m pretty torn]"
femalefashionadvice,"Gotcha! I have tactile issues too, just not with jeans. Jeans have been such a constant for me that I’d feel *super* weird giving them up. It would probably take an illness or injury that leads to neuropathy for me to make the switch (which isn’t outside the realm of possibility; I used to wear heels constantly until I broke my ankle)."
femalefashionadvice,"I think many replies to my comment are confusing the discussion I’m trying to make about the tone of the post versus it’s actual content. The post reads as very condescending and I agree with your comment on the tone used in describing dated looks, as well as the point about men not receiving the same tone in messaging. 

“wear whatever you want” includes adding newer trends to your wardrobe, whether they are from very young generations or trending among older women but not among younger. The point is to make choices because you enjoy them and you like the current fashion trends, not because you fear being an old and dated lady who’s not hip with the kids, which is the tone I got from this post. 

I also agree with you on that applying “wear whatever” everywhere is idealistic. Obviously you cannot wear a crop top to the office or job networking, you’d look silly. Same for fancy dinners or meeting partners’ families or whatever event requires more formal styles. This post is primarily about casual wardrobe choices though, and that’s why I said “wear whatever” because even if strangers judge you for what you wear to buy laundry detergent from Target, that judgment ultimately doesn’t affect you beyond that one moment (and shouldn’t!) There’s a time and a place for certain clothes, but if there’s no socially implied dress code, I don’t see why wearing “dated” clothing is passé."
femalefashionadvice,"For winter I'm wearing NB in black, it's just more practical than white. I'll break out the white ones when it warms up. 

I do prefer the white sneakers with dresses."
femalefashionadvice,"Oh! Okay. I should have moderated my response a little bit; a lot of comments in this post have made references to age that seemed kinda loaded to me so my hackles were slightly raised. Thank you for clarifying ❤️

I’m willing to bet the OP didn’t include anything distressed because just the concept of updating a wardrobe even *while* keeping skinny jeans has been contentious enough 😂 One shock to the system at a time!"
femalefashionadvice,"&gt; swing bob

I read an article just yesterday that claimed this style is coming back."
femalefashionadvice,"Thanks!

I found a forest green midi dress I like, do.you think that might be appropriate?"
femalefashionadvice,"They specified that low ankle boots were no longer in style - the examples shown after had, as they mentioned, a higher shaft. What’s out of fashion are boots where the shaft falls more around the ankle bone, probably falling more in the 6-8” range for shaft heights (so shorter than mid calf or knee boots). I didn’t spot anything with a clearly short shaft shown otherwise, however they’re certainly still wearable with different cuts of jeans without being clearly dated (ex longer jeans that cover most of the shoe).

I’m also a little baffled by like the revisionist fashion take that doc martens have always been popular, at least in a mainstream sense. Like sure, in 2000-2010 you could still buy doc martens… but they were only really seen in alternative fashion crowds. Beyond that, the boots shown do appear to be more of a platform style rather than the standard 1460 which is for sure a more modern take… though I think there could be a better example. 

Also - the bag shown is an unstructured bag. It’s an unlined tote bag with unfinished edges. Yeah, it’s not a totally shapeless hobo bag - but it’s not what would be called structured. Generally this is reserved for bags that hold their shape fairly well (the classic example is a Birken bag) or more loosely have very structured elements (ex I’ve seen some where the bay was clearly a softer leather, but had very rigid and structured handles). Less structured/big bags have been around a little more… but I’ve seen them with more finished handles/edges mostly. 

🤷‍♀️ also you not liking a silhouette doesn’t meant it isn’t one.  

Also, just as a millennial… I wonder if you are one as well or just are a very different age, because a lot of the looks are pretty typical/spot on examples and I’m 36. Like they’re not things I would have worn, but I was always more on the alternative end… but I wasn’t like… blind to what other people wore because I didn’t like it. 

I don’t fully agree with all the takes here and I think some of the examples of updates are already a little dated themselves… but this comment seems weirdly in denial of both more modern fashion and retrospectively looking back at fashion in years past."
femalefashionadvice,"I have 32"" waist and same hips and height as you and I've had good luck with Levi's Wedgie, especially the 100 cotton ones. They're all a bit different depending on the wash and fabric composition so try few different ones. Poshmark is good for that.  I also just bought amazing wide leg jeans from the Gap. I sized down after reading reviews and once hemmed, they'll be amazing. They make my brain so happy."
femalefashionadvice,Sounds like the rise is too long.
femalefashionadvice,"Yes, absolutely.

Some people replying to you are saying this means it must be too tight -- but this isn't the case. Postural changes can cause bad pressure (e.g., when sitting the waistband can be pulled against your stomach too much).

I avoid the perfectly-fitting high-waisted jeans on bad stomach days, personally. If it's a casual day, leggings without a constricting top band can be a great choice (I get mine from Aerie). Or I wear straight leg jeans with a looser waistband and a longer, loose top."
femalefashionadvice,"I’m commenting on the language used in the post and what it implies. There are certainly ways to convey the same message about updating style to current trends without as much negative language. I’m not assuming that millennials are trying to dress like Gen Z; I’m commenting on a larger societal structure of ageism that informs the language used in this post, and many of the trends listed here are things that Gen Z popularized, as most trends are generally born from younger generations. It’s not bashing anyone specifically; it’s discussing a larger view that indirectly encourages messaging. 

I also own a professional wardrobe for my job that definitely doesn’t make me look 21. There’s certainly a time and a place for clothing items. There also exists a lot of ageism combined with sexism in marketing towards women. Those two things can coexist."
femalefashionadvice,YES! I’m loving the pleated high waist trouser. I’m PP a year now with my 2nd and final baby and this is my look ✨
femalefashionadvice,"Okay so I made a comment a week or two ago about wanting to lean into my desire to piss off my inner-punk-13-year-old by finally letting myself go more Blair Waldorf. I’ve fought it for years on her behalf, I’ve merged the styles where I could to keep her happy, but I’m married with a house and a big kid job and I’m done letting her would be opinion of who we became be a factor in how I dress

So in caving to this I bought:

[this beauty](https://www.katespade.com/products/pearl-embellished-tweed-jacket/KB105.html) in store this weekend. I had been staring at it online, certain sizing up to go over my boobs would be too big in the shoulders, as my boobs are the bane of my existence and we are not friends. They had ONE left of the size I’d need to fit my bust in store and oh my god it was PERFECT. It’s heavy without seeming like it would be overly warm, the pearls seem very well attached, the construction and seams seem solid, the lining is smooth? I am dead

I also figured out when my local thrift restocks from drop boxes. Several surrounding towns they collect from are very wealthy, so finding this out was key. Managed to snag vintage miu miu and Chanel shoes on the cheap??? Hell yes

I also got [this dress](https://www.nordstrom.com/s/cece-tie-neck-ruffle-minidress/6628587?origin=keywordsearch-personalizedsort&amp;breadcrumb=Home%2FAll%20Results&amp;color=400) and it actually fits my hourglass figure far better than I expected? Our friend is doing a travel themed courthouse wedding next month, and depending on weather I may wear this with the vintage Chanel shoes and a beret for a French-stereotype outfit"
femalefashionadvice,"I still have all my great flared designer jeans from the last run! Loving high waisted trousers with fitted crop tops (at age 52!). 

Also, blazers are moving into the “cinched” zone now. So much more flattering than the boxy ones."
femalefashionadvice,"The chunky shoes example has been my uniform for the last 10 years. It’s nice to know that I’ve apparently been ahead of the trend all this time. 

Also, according to OP, full length hems are out? Someone should tell that to all the jean companies. Ankle pants are everywhere, including in some of the “do” examples from this very post."
femalefashionadvice,"I just read an article yesterday that claimed the ""Karen"" (stacked bob/LOB) is coming back...."
femalefashionadvice,"Definitely not jncos! LOL

It could just be my build but I have narrowish shoulders and a small bust size, but slightly wider hips. Wear anything too full on the bottom just looks disproportionate to my torso so it looks oversized."
femalefashionadvice,"This is why I feel like high rise/mid rise/low rise descriptions are absolutely meaningless. 

I'm 5'0 but have a proportionately long-ish torso for my height. My personal high rise is in the 10-11.5 inch range; 10 will be right above the belly button and 11.5 will be my natural waist. 8-9.5 inch is what I would consider mid-rise: 9.5 will hit right around the belly button, 8 inch is below and it's not a good look as I'll have love handles. Anything lower than 8 inch is low-rise on me, and will absolutely not stay up, not even with a belt, as my hips are straight. An 8 inch rise is ON my hip bone.  A 7 inch rise ... is downright obscene.  

I find it interesting that Old Navy considers a 10 inch rise ""extra high."" Their high rise is only 9 inches. Yet here in this thread some folks were saying 10 inch is mid-rise. I don't get it. Just tell me the rise in inches!"
femalefashionadvice,Yeah. It's really weird but it's just never looked good on me. I've got narrow shoulders and a small bust size so anything wide on the bottom where I have a wider hip size looks disproportionate.
femalefashionadvice,Were people wearing low-rise skinny jeans?? I must have missed that
femalefashionadvice,"Cool. As a thin person with a non-existent waist, all these new styles are going to look like I'm drowning in clothes. I'll stick to my low rise skinny/boyfriend jeans."
femalefashionadvice,Yeah the ‘what not to do’ is basically just describing what’s in my closet
femalefashionadvice,"Which brands out of these have the best quality jeans: Zara, H&amp;M, Stradivarius, Pull&amp;Bear, Cotton On, Mango, Gap, Old Navy. These are the only brands that are available here in my country and their price point is already considered expensive (most pairs of jeans from local brands  cost less than $20 but I don’t like the style). I’ve been thinking about splurging on Everlane just to get a pair that could last forever but I’m trying to explore more affordable options first."
femalefashionadvice,"That's a good idea, I will try that :)"
femalefashionadvice,"Try jegging styles? I'm the same height and typically a 2 at AE, size 9.5-10 feet and haven't had any issues with their jegging styles as they are quite stretchy"
femalefashionadvice,"What is it that doesn't work for you? I'll be more specific about what works for me. When I have a zipper, after sitting down, the zipper curves. Which is normal and was NBD before baby making. After my shape changed, I have this mound under my bellybutton (with a built in muffin top cuz c section) which sticks out more when I sit bc physics, and now zippers kinda mold around that mound. So then for the rest of the day even if my pooch isn't sticking out, my zipper is like, ""hey don't worry everyone, here is an exaggerated replica of it!"" Lol. Button flies don't take on the curve like that for me."
femalefashionadvice,"I stick to fashion week/designer following content for Instagram, or people who work as stylists sharing their tricks for how they help people make clothes work for their body and love it. I also like people who dress outside of the norm but get into why and how they do so. 

Algorithm still sometimes hits me with “clean girl” aesthetic nonsense but I’ve found focusing on engaging content I really actually found useful to very quickly resolve how much I’m bombarded by it

femalefashionadvice,"So as I’ve got an hourglass figure and am midsized, h&amp;m has made me feel like garbage for a hot minute trying to puzzle out their inconsistent and dog doo doo sizing, I’ve avoided them for years now since the quality and way I feel is just not worth the money, time, or experience

Was considering giving &amp;other stories a go… hadn’t realized until your comment since I’d not paid them much mind that they’re the same freaking company??

femalefashionadvice,"I recently had a surgery that has left me with a hard knot of painful scars on my belly button and upper stomach.

femalefashionadvice,"How to style low rise jeans in a modern way? I just ordered [these](https://www.madewell.com/the-low-rise-perfect-vintage-straight-jean-in-lunar-wash-NF117.html)low-rise black jeans. I’m not comfortable showing my belly, as in the photo. Given that, what type of shirt would work best? Tucked, untucked?"
femalefashionadvice,"I’ve tried it on in the stores but I’m still uncomfortable with it. A lot of the ones I tried (old navy) just expose my bra when I lift my arms. Like halfway up my chest. 

And I’ve got little kids. I have to do lots of lifting and running, preferably without a wardrobe malfunction. It’s frustrating and probably stemming from my own body image issues. But I have yet to find a look with a crop top that I liked. 

I do love the high waisted trend a lot though."
femalefashionadvice,What do you get out of being a jerk to people in the internet? Why does it bother you if someone likes something you deem dated?
femalefashionadvice,"Feet too big to put on skinny jeans?

Pretty much all of my jeans are levis, I currently wear a 26. I had weight loss surgery and I'm down almost 150 lbs now, I've never had this problem before. 

I'm somewhat tall, 5' 8"", and I have huge size 11 feet. In the size 26 skinny jeans from levis I can't get my feet through them. I have several pairs in straight/bootcut that fit fine in that size. 

Is there another brand with a similar skinny and a bigger foot hole? I tried american eagle today and ran into the same problem.

I love skinny jeans :("
femalefashionadvice,I have wide hips so low rise didn't and will never look good on me!
femalefashionadvice,But wide brim hats give sun protection!! I didn't think not getting skin cancer would fall out of style 😔
femalefashionadvice,You’re right - I left out a letter.  Corrected the link in my reply.
femalefashionadvice,"I don't know how old you are but the reality is when you get older, if you are more self assured, you really don't give a fuck if people are judging you because of your fashion. What matters are how the people you respect and hold in high regards think of you. And I guarantee those people aren't thinking less of you because you aren't buying into new trends every six months."
femalefashionadvice,"Unfortunately, many people are saying this tired “cold, dead hands” shit anyway. I don’t get it— this isn’t r/FemaleClothing it’s r/FemaleFashionAdvice. The resistance to the simple fact that OP is correct and the ‘10s skinny jean is not *fashionable* anymore is fuckin’ baffling. The wailing and gnashing of teeth about the inevitability of trends changing has gotten so old. Why come on a sub about FASHION and be obnoxiously vocal about how they will never keep up with fashion? No one has to be fashionable; it’s not a moral obligation. They should just wear their 2010s-era outfits with confidence and be happy. 

All the body hate in this thread is also so tired. Apparently people got told in their 2010s adolescence/young adulthood what was “flattering” on their bodies and interpreted that as objective, eternal truth, rather than accepting that what is seen as “flattering” is completely constructed and contingent on the trends and silhouettes of the day."
femalefashionadvice,"The trick is to tuck your top inside high waisted underwear (this is what we did in grade school back in the 70s). 

Or, hem your top to be a lot shorter so you don't have excess fabric bunching around your butt (this is what I've had to do with every trade show booth shirt I've ever had to wear for work).  

Or, just buy a shorter top to begin with (i.e., cropped, but long enough that it hits at the waistband/high hip -- what we used to call ""skirt length""). Or, buy a body suit and deal with the inconvenience in the restroom."
femalefashionadvice,"My brain is struggling to see them as in style again after flares went out so decidedly with the skinny Jean/legging takeover. I KNOW they are but my brain still goes “ew”, I wore flares in the early aughts like crazy so it’s so weird to go there again and with a much squishier mom bod."
femalefashionadvice,"I'm literally wearing skinny jeans, thin cardigan and a turtleneck. There is no saving me"
femalefashionadvice,Yea I definitely like the fitted leg for function and for style! Thanks for the recommendation! I'll go try those on!
femalefashionadvice,It hurt me lol but now I get to go shopping so yay.
femalefashionadvice,"Incredibly judgemental and childish. 

I think you sound very well spoken and I appreciate your input. It doesn't sound like you've given up at all. You embrace your own style and that doesn't have to fit in with the capitalistic hyper consumerism of changing trends every 6 months. Nothing beats knowing yourself better and feeling more confident about your place in the world. I hope the PP grows up and realizes how liberating it is to not give a fuck about other people judging you because you aren't ""on trend."""
femalefashionadvice,I love the overalls idea! What brand?
femalefashionadvice,"It turns out I was in denial because. I stopped wearing skinny jeans because I started wearing leggings which let’s face it, is just as bad, if not worse. Literally read this post in leggings, a long thin cardigan, and a graphic tank."
femalefashionadvice,I'd agree that it's on par with Madewell and Everlane.  Not as good as Veronica Beard or Anine Bing.
femalefashionadvice,"&gt;We still see a lot of millennials sporting a long dark wing and overly contoured face though, so not sure what you’re on about there.
&gt;
&gt;To your last point, I have no idea what you’re talking about. Maybe that was just you and your friend group who judged people for updating their styles. 

I didn't mean me and my friends, I'm talking about memes [like this one](https://starecat.com/men-over-30-in-skinny-jeans-bulldog-thin-legs/) that were doing the rounds. I'm not saying nobody over 30 looked good wearing them or that every single person judged them, just that they were often seen as more of a clothing item for younger people and people over 30 weren't often seen as ""out of date"" for sticking with their usual clothes, but rather dressing their age.

&gt;you can either resist it or go with it. People who are more conservative or fearful of change will resist and people who are more open-minded and liberal will welcome change. 

I think this is very much a matter of perspective. I think it's more open minded and liberal to think ""you do you"" and ""wear what makes you happy"", and more conservative to think that it's important to keep up with the Jones / follow trends. That feels less individualistic and more crowd following. Picking clothes to impress others rather than picking what you're drawn to is not very liberal minded to me.

&gt;This is a female fashion advice sub and this post is specifically about millennials updating their skinny jeans.

I know this is what the post is about, but there are a lot of comments wondering why people are clinging to skinnies so naturally people who like skinnies are going to reply to that. 

&gt;Where I’m getting annoyed is people proclaiming they don’t care what people think of them (in their outdated skinny jeans) when literally all of us care what other people think of us. That’s human nature. 

Really? You genuinely care so much what others think that you can't comprehend that people exist who don't? You think everyone who says that is just lying? I really, truly, 100% don't care if someone thinks my jeans are outdated. That strikes me as a petty and judgmental thought to have about another person. I genuinely value a live and let live mentality. You do you. Wear what makes you happy. If you like to be trendy or change up your look - great! If you love the way skinnies look - great! If you hate the way they look - great, don't wear them! People like different things. I don't like the look of some of the pictures here, and therefore won't emulate them in my own wardrobe, but that's my personal preference and if people like them - more power to them. It's not that hard to grasp. 

The only ""human nature"" caring about what people think part is wanting people to see me as a decent person. But I can't care what people think more deeply than that because people aren't a monolith and it's literally impossible to be liked or admired by everyone. What one person loves about me another will hate so I just put my energy into caring about what my loved ones think and what makes me happy. 

&gt; That’s why you’re here looking for advice and tips on your style.

I already said why I'm here (and why others are). Inspiration. Ideas. Someone might post a dress and I go ooh I'd like that. Someone else might most a shirt and I go ""nah not for me"". It isn't about ""caring about what people think"". It isn't that deep. You can want to get clothing ideas because clothing is fun rather than because you worry about being judged. I have no idea how this isn't obvious."
femalefashionadvice,I love the Elation line from Athleta for yoga. Soft and similar(ish) to Lululemon Align. Wider leg and flares are becoming trendy again in yogawear but personally I prefer a fitted leg as I don't like fabric flapping around.
femalefashionadvice,"I love the Lauren Conrad photo, a true millennial style icon."
femalefashionadvice,"r/fashionwomens35 - here on Reddit

wardrobe oxygen - Allison is a size 14 and is short; definitely a GenXer

unefemme.net - I love Susan for her travel capsules in particular; also I would kill to own all her shoes. She's gotten into color theory recently so if you are a Spring you'll particularly like her inspiration. 

youlookfab - Angie (definitely a GenXer) is a professional stylist; the community is worth joining. Her clothing round-ups are always spot on. 

50isnotold - recently started following this blogger as she features a lot of inexpensive clothes from Amazon, Wal-Mart, LOFT etc"
femalefashionadvice,Beautiful!!!
femalefashionadvice,I’d say solidly Everlane and Madewell but it varies by piece. I’ve bought quite a bit from them in the past and have generally found some of the nicer pieces to wear well but they’re the ones on the higher price point as well. The cheapest items probably are like high end H&amp;M.
femalefashionadvice,"“Subreddit doesn’t exist”, did you mean something else maybe?"
femalefashionadvice,"Quality is well below any of the names you mention, more at the upper end of H&amp;M. When they opened Other Stories they stopped offering hot trends in H&amp;M, which is not a coincidence. I do have a couple of pieces from there - like H&amp;M, you can find the odd bargain - but I would never buy anything from them that I hadn't inspected closely in person, as their pictures really don't tell the full story."
femalefashionadvice,Oh I'll have to look up Werkshop! Sounds like Athleta is the way to go! Do you have a favorite style at Athleta?
femalefashionadvice,"Unlike other bands in their price points, Abercrombie will fit clothes on a model again and again until it's just right. Other similar brands will get one sample from the factory, send fit notes and put it straight into production. Abercrombie also wear test anything going into production to make sure it holds up. They definitely have an edge when it comes to quality in the cheaper price range."
femalefashionadvice,"This is so good, do you have suggestions for tops and skirts. I've been doing this sort of dark/light academia look lately but want better options."
femalefashionadvice,"For me it's not that other options exist, I think that's fantastic and feel bad for the people who didn't like skinnies once they took over. It's the elimination of other cuts when something comes into style that makes it difficult. Like I'm never giving up my skinnies, since that is most flattering on my body type, but it would SUCK if I couldn't get skinnies anymore because wide leg are the only thing for sale anywhere. That's my problem with on trend fashion and I totally welcome all types of styles even if they aren't for me!"
femalefashionadvice,"Great tip, thanks! I wear Birkenstock Sandles during the summer so could definitely do more"
femalefashionadvice,"I have done both, depending on my outfit and/or the weather! I mostly wear black or brown Blundstones and have a lot of cropped pants that show around 2-3"" of my shin/ankle. Lately I've paired them with [ruffle socks](https://www.freepeople.com/shop/movement-ruffle-sneaker-sock-2-pack/?category=socks&amp;color=001&amp;type=REGULAR&amp;size=One%20Size&amp;quantity=1) for shorter options or a higher [patterned sock](https://zkano.com/collections/womens-crew-socks) (when it's cooler) that matches the rest of the outfit. I don't think I've ever done no show socks."
femalefashionadvice,"My legs are so short, like a Corgi dog, I feel like the white shoes cut me off, but maybe I'm just hypercritical of myself.    The white NB sound like a good option for comfort reasons.   Will investigate.     Thanks!"
femalefashionadvice,"No white is the only big 'no no' in the UK.  
If you want to play it really safe, I'd recommend not going for any pastel colors/anything that could make you look like a bridesmaid either. If you wanted to be super vigilant, ask your SO to find out the wedding party colors so that you can avoid wearing those.

&amp;#x200B;

By Rotation is a great peer-to-peer clothing rental site in the UK. They have a good [wedding guest dress](https://journal.byrotation.com/wedding-guest-edit/)article here- should give you a good idea of what Brits wear to weddings. You can't really go wrong with a floral midi tbh."
femalefashionadvice,"GenXer here as well, on the older side of the generation. Up until 6th grade, we wore light wash disco bell bottomed high rise jeans, then overnight those went out of fashion and it was mid-rise straight legged or bootcut dark wash jeans (from the GAP) for a long long time until the early 90s. I cannot wear low rises at all (they slip right off my straight hips) so I pretty much stopped wearing jeans in the 2000s. 

I love high rise and find them to be the most comfortable (even though I'm short) and most flattering. And I really like high rise skinny jeans as they suit my figure. But I've always been a sucker for a dramatic flare and have indulged on and off whenever they were a fringe trend. 

So now I have a pair of flares again and .... it's so weird. I know they look great, but I feel weird in them, like ... ""uh, I've been here before."" They may look fresh to the younger set but to my eye somehow they feel dated. 

I would like to add a pair of wide leg jeans but then I consider my 80 year old mom, and that's what she's worn for decades. 

Personally I don't mind the frayed hem trend and hope it sticks around, as it is quite easy to just cut my jeans to the right length for my short self, no tailor required. 

Boxy tops can work, but they have to be scaled just so, otherwise like you said, it's a sloppy mess. And with petites disappearing from the stores, it's a challenge."
femalefashionadvice,I feel this! I have a six month old and now have a prominent belly and flat butt. I really like the wide leg jean trend but have found it next to impossible to find a pair that fits an apple shape well. There is so much extra fabric in the front crotch area when it fits at my waist. Anyone have recs for brands that work for an apple shape?
femalefashionadvice,"Hey, what’s the sock move right now with ankle grazing pants or slightly higher?  I usually wear boots with pants that hit there just to save myself the trouble but it’s getting warmer so they’re not always the most comfortable.  Low cut socks?  No show socks?  Tube socks and just embrace the sock show?"
femalefashionadvice,"I find what you say interesting, and idk who is doing the downvoting (well, I have an idea). I see your point in that you choose to dress a certain way because it has deeper meaning to you. I believe Billie Eilish made a similar choice prior to her turning 18. And why wouldn’t she when you can see the damage the media has done to pop stars by turning them into hyper sexual objects before they can legally consent to sexual relations.

It happens to be trendy now. Would you choose to still dress this way if, hypothetically, next week we were back to the sexy glitter explosion of the early aughts? (I say hypothetical as if we’re not headed that way 🙄)."
femalefashionadvice,"I've seen Werkshop leggings on men look amazing and the triathlon fabric would be great for Hiit.
Athleta offers a tall fit which on full length( not 7/8) leggings might be 31"" which would be ideal for you for yoga. Sizewise, you'll have narrower hips, proportionately, than many women so I might start with size L and see how that feels."
femalefashionadvice,Thank you! I wish they listed the actual rise of them because they definitely seem high! Maybe customer service will give me an answer lol.
femalefashionadvice,I don’t think OP’s suggestions had any tears so I was curious. I like them too though!
femalefashionadvice,"I appreciate this, but I think there's more context that needs to be added.  I love this post precisely because it *doesn't* try to get millennials to dress fully like Gen Z, but to inform those who are interested how to update millennial style while taking into account macrotrends.

I think there's an assumption in your post that millennials are trying to dress like Gen Z and look like they're 25 (please correct me if that wasn't your intent).  I think most of us millennials know we're not 25, and we aren't dressing for Gen Z - we're dressing for our millennial peers and maybe those a bit older than us, too.  There's a difference in following large macrotrends to look current, and trying to look young.

As an example, I'm a college professor and I teach mostly Gen Z students.  I really appreciate their style, but I'm not trying to replicate it exactly myself.  I'm trying to look my age (mid-30s), while looking current and modeling professionalism.  I also co-own a boutique consulting firm, and looking modern and professional is good for business.  It's no substitute for competency, but it does make a difference."
femalefashionadvice,"I'm 5'6"" 120lbs. I've found I like a high, snug waist and a looser leg, instead of all over oversized. Also - it might just be that you're used to how you look in skinny jeans so it looks or feels weird to you but it's actually totally fine."
femalefashionadvice,Careful with clogs in Europe. Depending on where you’re going you might as well put on muck boots and overalls and call it a day.
femalefashionadvice,"Lululemon Groove pants are ""super high rise"" which hit me somewhere up my ribcage, lol"
femalefashionadvice,"If I gave up skinny jeans, my flares would be flopping soggily in all the snow mush right now."
femalefashionadvice,Thank you. I honestly would have just rolled the dice for most things but $200 is expensive for a top and I’ve not made any purchases from them before
femalefashionadvice,"Amazing advice OP. I love the oversized bottoms/cropped t-shirt look but I always struggle with shoes. The thought of wearing boots under flared or baggy pants makes me *cringe,* and the pants usually have too much fabric to successfully roll up. I usually wear platform white shoes or black chunky shoes but I want to branch out more. Would love a spotlight post on shoes."
femalefashionadvice,I don't buy jeans often but I got slim straights and slender bootcuts at American Eagle in the last several years. (I'm tall and find their offerings are a simple way to make sure I get real tall lengths.)
femalefashionadvice,"For a black tie wedding this summer:
[L’Agence floral silk dress](https://lagence.com/products/kenna-dress-black-red-rose)
Betsey Johnson glitzy pink [floral boots](https://betseyjohnson.com/products/sb-cadyf-floral-multi) and [purse](https://betseyjohnson.com/collections/handbags/products/sparkler-convertible-bag-floral-multi)"
femalefashionadvice,"We still see a lot of millennials sporting a long dark wing and overly contoured face though, so not sure what you’re on about there.

To your last point, I have no idea what you’re talking about. Maybe that was just you and your friend group who judged people for updating their styles. I still remember me and my older sister giving my mom a make over and she looked stunning in her skinny jeans and side parted, straightened hair.

My motivation really stems from learning we become solidified in our beliefs by about 25 and it’s very hard for us to deviate from said beliefs. And also that technology (this includes fashion, make up, etc) is always evolving and you can either resist it or go with it. People who are more conservative or fearful of change will resist and people who are more open-minded and liberal will welcome change. 

But where I’ll agree with the onslaught of people who disagree with me is that it’s ultimately your lives, you can do whatever you want. But I’m allowed to criticize just like you’re doing to me. This is a female fashion advice sub and this post is specifically about millennials updating their skinny jeans.

Where I’m getting annoyed is people proclaiming they don’t care what people think of them (in their outdated skinny jeans) when literally all of us care what other people think of us. That’s human nature. That’s why you’re here looking for advice and tips on your style."
femalefashionadvice,"I mean, you're not wrong, but based off the way this sub's response, people still need to be told it."
femalefashionadvice,"How about a slender straight leg? So not tight but not super loose either. I find it gives a more updated effect without much affecting your shape, not like wide legs or any kind of flare does. And then you can focus more on updating your tops, footwear, or accessories (if it's important to look more trendy)."
femalefashionadvice,Pants styles take *a lot* longer to change than other trends. I got my first pair of skinny jeans in 2004. I started replacing all of mine in 2020. So 16 years where I wore basically nothing but skinny jeans.

Is this okay for an outdoor wedding in June? The ceremony is outside and the reception is in a barn"
femalefashionadvice,"You might like straight jeans that are cut more like a skinny from the waist to knee, and are then looser from the knee down.  These styles usually have a higher stretch content, which is more reminiscent of skinny jeans.  I'm thinking of something like [this](https://www.ayr.com/products/the-pop-laid-back?_pos=1&amp;_sid=14d314d03&amp;_ss=r#31840497926223) or [this](https://www.madewell.com/search?q=stovepipe&amp;lang=default&amp;context=women) (not necessarily these exact pairs, but the overall style/effect)."

femalefashionadvice,"How is the quality of &amp; Other Stories? I've seen one or two particular redditors here rave about it, but it always seems to be the same individuals, so just curious of other people's opinion. I've heard it's better than H&amp;M, but how does it compare to say... Everlane and Madewell (very middle, average in my opinion)"
femalefashionadvice,"Oh, it's really cute.  Especially as an idea for my little daughter haha...it matches her personality a lot.  I'm not sure it would work on me.  But I like the idea, thank you.  Maybe I will work up the courage.  (Omg I sound so old lol.)"
femalefashionadvice,"I think today’s ballet flats are narrower (come up higher on the sides), have a higher vamp (higher on the toes), and often lean more almond than round toe. Think Chanel or (more affordably) Everlane flats. It’s more common to see bows on them now too. 

That said - if you like them, that’s what matters most."
femalefashionadvice,I use Charly Goss and also her business’ Instagram pages. She has some great highlights.
femalefashionadvice,"You definitely *can* wear what you want/what you think is flattering, and ignore trends!  People do that all the time, and the world doesn't stop :).  But that's a different goal than *wanting* to look modern/avoid looking dated.  This post is for those who have that goal, and that's ok.  

Wearing dated clothes doesn't make you a bad person, just like wearing current styles doesn't make you a good person.  Some people choose to stay current with their clothes because 1) it gives them a career advantage (in some contexts), and/or 2) they enjoy fashion and style.  Both of those are valid things.  Choosing to opt out of trends is also valid."
femalefashionadvice,"Recently purchased this shirt from [Sessun](https://static.sessun.com/icache/size/1860c2325/themes/sessun/images/catalog/product/WXL-_Colonella_sandblue-026.webp). It doesn't look like much but the fabric is the coolest fabric I've ever felt. Thick, smooth, and incredibly drapey. Completely oversized (as many of Sessun's tops can be, so usually a Medium, sized down to an XS for[this fit](https://i8.amplience.net/i/liberty/000766466-R480445006-2?$large$&amp;qlt=70&amp;fmt=auto&amp;strip=true) rather than [this fit](https://i8.amplience.net/i/liberty/000766466-R480445006-3?$large$&amp;qlt=70&amp;fmt=auto&amp;strip=true))

The description says:

&gt;Colonella shirt, inspired by men-style, two-colored striped mercerized yarns fluid weaving woven in France. 

I don't know what mercerized yarns fluid weaving is (the Sessun website has always been jankity on the ENG translation) but whatever it is I want 100x more of this fabric. Also washing machine friendly, which is my favorite. Discovering mercerized cotton might be the best fashion thing to happen to me since I discovered silk twill."
femalefashionadvice,Old navy!
femalefashionadvice,Oooh yes I second this request!
femalefashionadvice,"I actually went through most (maybe all?) of the perfect vintage styles on the website at one point last fall and made a spreadsheet of the measurements &amp; material. Most of the high rise perfect vintage had 11” rise, except the Heathcote and Hoye (vintage straight) which had 11.25”. All of the mid-rise perfect vintage that I had noted had 9.5”, and the one mid-rise skinny I noted had 9.25”."
femalefashionadvice,"Also 5'0, also love flares, also have plantar fasciitis. I am wearing flares with my Brooks Ghosts, or white New Balances. When you're shorter, it works best if your flares are high waisted and full length rather than cropped. 

I've got some cropped kick flares and to my eye those work best with an ankle boot with a chunky heel, which I'm having trouble wearing at the moment due to the PF issues."
femalefashionadvice,"Yeah I have ""pencil legs"" so even normal proportions can look baggy on me so the more tailored or slim fits generally just end up looking normal on me. When I can find them. That's where I'm just nervous that this move back to 90s baggy/oversized looks will make that even more challenging to find. So you're right I should have been more clear.

I guess I'm just calling out that us lanky/scrawny folks have a hard time with proportions like curvier folks have with the slimmer ones. I mean wear crop tops regardless of your waist size if you feel good in it, but for those that don't.  When I was in HS in the late 90s/early 00s I had strict parents and a long torso so everything showed my middrift when I raised my hands but it was what was in style and we couldn't afford a lot so it was just hard growing up with rarely having clothes that fit or were considered appropriate. Maybe that's just what I struggle against most. Welp, I know my next counseling topic! Thanks!"
femalefashionadvice,American Eagle
femalefashionadvice,Where to find fashion inspiration? pinterest’s algorithm kinda sucks and keeps showing either the same images or products/shops. instagram is a little overwhelming to dive into (also a little monotonous as a lot of influencers have similar content). Any other sites that are interesting and fresh?
femalefashionadvice,You might look up a French bob - it's a more modern take on that length!
femalefashionadvice,"Low rise is in rn, just not with skinnies"
femalefashionadvice,Birkenstock bostons are having a very big moment and I’ve liked them with a lot of outfits and kick flare crop jeans. Lots of arch support. Also recommend insoles to create it yourself! They’re good in shoes like doc martens.
femalefashionadvice,"[These are the flats I bought for the 2023 spring and summer season](https://www.ebay.com/itm/394294395747).  Do you think they will jive with the seasons' looks?

Thanks!"
femalefashionadvice,"I’d honestly start out by experimenting with the cheap jewelry that you can find anywhere, then once your confident upgrade to more quality pieces. Newer styles are simple gold dainty jewelry, or excessive layering depending on your style."
femalefashionadvice,I think it’s more important to feel confident and comfortable in what you wear than an up-to-date wardrobe. I still rock “mom jeans” that my friends beg me to get rid of lol.
femalefashionadvice,"Man, I’ve been telling everyone, people are really sleeping on Old Navy lately. Some of their jeans are very flattering on me and I agree they helped me get out of skinny jeans. 

Madewell has been weird too. Their “perfect vintage jean” is EVERYWHERE and I look very dumpy in them, haha. Their stovepipe sucks on me too. I hope they’ll make some changes at some point."
femalefashionadvice,"I've seen people ask why they can't wear something that flatters their bodies and I'd like to challenge you to go back over the example photos. Notice how the top ones sometimes illustrate what not to do -- and the what not to do is not flattering at all! 

Also, I didn't see /u/squeegee-beckenheim talk about cropped flares or cropped anything except perhaps as a think-twice-about-it warning. I saw them talk about straight cuts, though, so if you needed a dressy jean and wanted to think about going ever so slightly wider in the leg than a skinny, a slim straight might be for you! And if you get a skinny for your dressy jeans, there are things that you can do to bring them forward into this decade. Your options are not solely mom jeans or ""big ol jinco's""."
femalefashionadvice,"I’m pregnant right now so there’s a bit of a moratorium on buying pants at the moment, but I’m stoked that wide legs are back in style. I loved how they looked when I was in early college (2008ish) and think they are quite flattering. Can’t wait to get me a pair of those come fall!"
femalefashionadvice,Great advice! Thank you! I definitely have a death grip on my skinny jeans and low ankle boots lol
femalefashionadvice,I love a good kick crop jean but I wear dresses more than anything myself. One and done outfit. So easy and so comfortable
femalefashionadvice,"Not everyone has kids though, and this is kinda weird body shaming. Everyone knows what your body looks like and *that’s fine.* There is nothing stopping you from wearing a form fitting top and looking good in it. Don’t heckle yourself out of a good outfit before you even try it. 

(Signed, a midsize person without kids who looks good in crop tops)"
femalefashionadvice,"Thank you!!!! This is why I hate straight jeans, my body is not straight!!!"
femalefashionadvice,"It took me F O R E V E R to find a cut of non-skinny jeans that worked for me and my shape. I’d go to Madewell and be like “This is what’s in style? This is the look? Am I supposed to feel like I’m wearing a flour sack for pants?” 

But! It turns out I just don’t fit perfectly into Madewell’s pants and that’s super hard to tell when you are trying out a new style because it’s not immediately obvious what it’s supposed to look like on you. 

I ended up getting some straight leg mom-jeany pants that actually look really cute on me from Old Navy and it turns out I fit perfectly into their standard sizes and now buying non-skinny jeans is a cinch. 

And then I got pregnant and now I’m back to a skinny jeans and tunic top silhouette because there’s no point in trying to be trendy right now and that’s what covers the belly 😥 

I did treat myself to an oversize blazer though and I think that’s a really fun look!"
femalefashionadvice,"These are the flats I bought for the spring/summer season](https://www.ebay.com/itm/394294395747).  Do you think they will jive with the seasons' looks?

femalefashionadvice,"Alright but what about those of us trying to hide a large stomach? (Plus size, a lot of weight in the tummy; most of the examples show off the exact area i want to minimise.)"
femalefashionadvice,I don’t think it’s misogynistic — the exact same jokes are made all the time about suburban dads in their outfit-inappropriate sneakers and tucked in polo shirts. If anything it’s making fun of arguably the most socially powerful class in America.
femalefashionadvice,I was in Spain last summer and the white sneakers are still very prevalent.
femalefashionadvice,"Love love this look for the 40s gal here. I had already started transitioning to straight legs, flares but this just broke it all down :) thanks!"
femalefashionadvice,Hell yeah! That's so exciting to me. Thank you!!!
femalefashionadvice,"As someone with a long torso and apple shape, I struggled with crop tops in the 90s and I struggle with them now. Also I know everyone tucks their shirts in now, but I feel like I look like Steve Urkel every time I do it."
femalefashionadvice,"Its honestly so wild to see these fits come back into style. I remember when low rise flair and fitted graphic tees was all that anyone wore for so long, I literally lived in Aeropostale as a kid. And then one day in 8th grade, suddenly it was skinny jeans skinny jeans skinny jeans. I'm 27 now and I'm still not ready to let them ago 🤣 

I don't know what to do about shoes but I'm open to trying a straight leg or a boot cut jeans. I like a good clogged heel but I'm a huge walker and those are not conducive for that for long periods."
femalefashionadvice,"This is very helpful and gives me a good idea of what to look for, thank you!"
femalefashionadvice,Your outfit looks very effortless in a super cool way. I'd say this is a success!

femalefashionadvice,FANTASTIC post! This must have taken a ton of work to write and source pictures. It's a terrific resource. Thank you so much for posting!
femalefashionadvice,Yes! High waisted jeans look terrible on me. I need a mid-rise.
femalefashionadvice,I kind of read frump and oversized and trendy but unattractive fashion as a complement to modern feminism and enjoy the statement that our bodies aren't just for attractive display

femalefashionadvice,"Hi,

What do you mean by evening shoes?
The wedding and after-party will continue till midnight at the same venue."
femalefashionadvice,"Same. I own two pairs of skinny jeans, where before ALL my pants were skinny jeans. Now when I wear them, they feel so constricting"
femalefashionadvice,"The ones i have are 79% cotton, 20% recycled cotton, and 1% eslastane. I think the ones i am looking at are 100% cotton but ive messaged the seller to be certain"
femalefashionadvice,Have you tried a half tuck? That's my go to
femalefashionadvice,I have the same problem! But I do it anyway. I've watched countless videos and I think my body is just slightly off that it never looks 100% the way I want it to look but it gets close so I'm like 🤷🏻‍♀️

femalefashionadvice,"Have you checked the fiber content? 

Madewell for example has different mixes of cotton and stretch even in the same styles. Higher cotton - less stretch, less likely to loosen."
femalefashionadvice,"Totally agree, I keep one pair of skinny jeans for boot purposes."
femalefashionadvice,Y’all’s comments are blowing my mind because I feel the exact opposite! I wish button flies worked better on me but Levi’s confirms they do not every time I try them on 😭
femalefashionadvice,"Seriously try the crop tops if you haven't.  In the H&amp;M plus size line, for example.  I also have very big boobs (38HH) and avoided even trying anything for years because I just assumed it wouldn't fit.  Finally I said fuck it and ordered some...some of them don't fit, but some of them actually look really good!

You don't have to expose your whole midriff, either.  If you wear them with high-waisted skirts or bottoms, only a little sliver of belly will show.  Alternatively, you can go with a cami, bodysuit, or dress underneath."
femalefashionadvice,"I get it’s trendy, but unless you’re super tall, you’re just going to look like a Clydesdale with flared pants… and while I do love straight leg, why in the world is it so damn hard to find a decent mid/low rise for us short torsos? I feel like it’s the most elusive item in the world. Good riddance to skinny legs, but lord knows the struggle finding jeans that aren’t up to my tits."
femalefashionadvice,True.
femalefashionadvice,Yep.

femalefashionadvice,"I thought it was just me. With all due respect, I had to work to get through this post because of the writing style."
femalefashionadvice,"Oh that's interesting! I guess it might also be how the pants were patterned so that it's got too much fabric in all the wrong places. That said, I think having the waist band taken in is a relatively easy alteration if you want to consider taking future pants to a tailor. 

For the leg, yes it might be that your thighs are shorter in proportion to the length of your leg! I have this problem sometimes since I have short legs for my height, but everyone can have different leg proportions in general."
femalefashionadvice,"Ehh, I can't do low or mid-rise . Like my torso's already hella long enough and my legs are stubby. But everything else is pretty useful though!"
femalefashionadvice,"This is excellent, thank you!!

Two things I'd like advice on:

1. Hair!  I always wore a [swing bob](https://hairstylesweekly.com/images/2015/10/medium-inverted-bob-hairstyle-with-highlights.jpg), not quite Kate Gosselin but not in fashion anymore.  About five years ago when I felt like I just couldn't get away with it anymore, I just let it grow long and always wear it in a high ponytail now.  My hair is stick straight and stubborn so I missed that whole mermaid waves trend unfortunately.  Now that that trend has receded, I can't figure out what's in style anymore.  I'd like to get back to some kind of below-chin, above-shoulder style, but what options do I have??

2. If anyone has any TikTok (or YouTube, etc.) recommendations that cover this exact topic - updating your wardrobe, looking modern as a mom - I would love to see them!"
femalefashionadvice,"If you have a steamer, steam it. If you don't have a steamer, either wet a towel and put it together in the dryer, or put it in your bathroom door closed, no fan while you take a hot shower."
femalefashionadvice,That “very awkward to tuck into” photo may be having the opposite of the desired effect. Because that look was phenomenal
femalefashionadvice,"I love this, thank you! 

Practical solutions are so rare on this sub, and this post is gold!"
femalefashionadvice,Here for this!!
femalefashionadvice,"Absolutely this.  I'm only 5' tall, and love flare jeans.   Unfortunately, I have plantar fasciitis so can't wear heels, even though I love the look.  Tried platform white sneakers and doesn't look good on someone with a 26' inseam.  Really need shoe help."
femalefashionadvice,"I struggle so hard-core with finding mom jeans and straight jeans that look good on my body type. I'm a size 10 and 5'4"" - measurements are 34"" bra band, 31"" waist, 39"" hips. I carry a lot of extra skin in my hips from weight loss and the natural flow of gravity just sends everything down. I feel like mom and straight jeans make me look frumpy as hell and don't do anything for my waist. I \*love\* me a good pair of flares, though and am on the hunt for a couple good pairs."
femalefashionadvice,[I think so](https://www.extrapetite.com/2021/10/how-to-tuck-a-chunky-knit-sweater-video-tutorial.html)!
femalefashionadvice,"Agreed, I’ve found a cut at Old Navy, the Mid-Rise Power Slim Straight Jeans, and they’re the perfect balance IMO if you can wear denim to work like I can."
femalefashionadvice,Oh duh I hadn't even thought of tucking them in. Can one tuck in a sweater without looking foolish? I have several tunic sweaters but they're thin fabric
femalefashionadvice,You could try some converse :) they work really well with wide pants!
femalefashionadvice,"I work in Central London, am in the same age bracket as you, and was a little overwhelmed as to what to wear for 'in the office' days after several years of WFH. Wide-leg, full-length trousers are everywhere, as are simple cargo trousers (not the OTT 90s ones!). There are still lots of Veja trainers, ballet pumps and chunky boots and sandals around. Personally I am struggling to return to heels, so generally wear a chunky smart-ish trainer to make the commute a little easier. A lot of people are going for New Balance trainers. Also...over-sized blazers.

femalefashionadvice,"I was unaware that a rule of this sub is to shut up and follow along. I think you’ll find several well regarded fashionistas who would tell you to piss off with that nonsense. 

Criticism can also be advice. Which is also fashion. The rejection of a trend is also saying something. In this case, several people are saying they’re not willing to wear trendy pieces at the expense of comfort and a flattering silhouette. 

Nice touch with the passive aggressive insult, though. *chefs kiss* My one criticism? Take it to the snark sub with the rest of the mean girls, please."
femalefashionadvice,Have you tried hanging it straight out of the washer after sort of flapping it with gusto a couple of times?  It sounds silly but that's what works for me.
femalefashionadvice,"I don't wear pants at all so no worries there.  I do buy a new pair of ballet flats for spring/summer yearly.  [these](https://www.ebay.com/itm/394294395747) are the ones I bought for this year.  

Are they dated?  

Thanks.  :)"
femalefashionadvice,Are cropped flares still stylish?
femalefashionadvice,"Flare leggings have been a lifesaver! After my baby I lost the weight very quickly but was later put on an antidepressant which made me gain it all back + an additional 30lbs on top of my heaviest pregnancy weight. I’ve been wearing flare leggings for about a year now and they are so flattering and don’t make me feel outdated like my “comfort” skinny jeans do. In the summer I wear a cute boxy tee or tank over them and in the winter I’ve worn oversized sweaters over them and I swear they have kept my sanity. My favs are from American eagle. Also, I pair them with some platform sneakers which were intimidating at first but now all I wear is platforms lol. They are so flattering as well."
femalefashionadvice,Short person with a short torso here and I swear by Gap’s mid rise (their high waisted stuff is also okay on me if necessary).
femalefashionadvice,Your reply has me laughing out loud trying not to wake  my husband. That’s exactly how it felt.
femalefashionadvice,"Great post, thank you for taking time to post with all pictoral examples"
femalefashionadvice,Very excited I don’t feel the need to shave my ankles in the dead of winter anymore
femalefashionadvice,Have you tried steaming it?
femalefashionadvice,"I think flared jeans are easier to wear when they're a little too short compared to skinny jeans. With too-short skinny jeans, your choices are tall boots, no socks, or a weird horrible sock-strip between your pants and shoes. Too-short flares hide that a little."
femalefashionadvice,"I love this post, thanks for making it!! 

I am finding the mom-jeans, bootcut/flared jeans so so difficult to get on with. I wore the low rise bootcut jeans to death in my teens/early 20s (whereas the mom jeans just scream ugly 80s fashion to me and I can’t get past it. Does no one even remember the mom jeans SNL sketch from about 10 years ago?) and I live in a wet, cold country so short/cropped straight leg jeans aren’t going to work without some ugly ankles, red raw from the cold, being on show. 

I’m always either walking the dog or at work (a job that i 100% do not need to be fashionable for. I can wear what I like as long as movement isn’t restricted) so stretchy skinnies that I can shove on with trainers or walking boots (wider leg jeans with knee high boots = farmer chic) has just been such an easy option.  

I am officially unfashionable :("
femalefashionadvice,"As a 31 year old that spent 2007-2012 almost exclusively in flats resulting in bad foot pain/issues, are there any super comfortable but still cute flats you can recommend?"
femalefashionadvice,"Honestly, if you’re willing and able to pay for the advice, I’d hire someone. There are lots of “wardrobe consultants” out there (a friend used one for workwear) that you could hire locally, or you could buy a styling appointment with someone online. Charly Goss’s whole brand is “cool mom” and bringing people into updated silhouettes. They sell styling appointments where they go through all your current clothes and come up with a plan on what to buy to round things out."
femalefashionadvice,"White sneakers still going strong, but steadily moving away from the extra chunky dad versions"
femalefashionadvice,"Nobody is saying you can’t be nicely dressed and put together in dated clothes, but you won’t be fashionable. Again, this is a fashion sub, it’s literally in the name. What’s unreasonable to me is going to a fashion advice sub and then complaining that people are giving fashion advice. And by the way, it’s 100% possible to be fashionable at 30+ without dressing or looking like a teenager.

Not saying you should yourself contribute a post like this because the subject matter is clearly not in your wheelhouse. But once more, this is a fashion advice sub, so you are free to ask for fashion advice from those that are more knowledgeable than you."
femalefashionadvice,"I'm not giving up my skinny jeans because I'm in the middle of a weight loss journey. And in the summer, I rarely wear jeans. So I'll deal with this in the fall! I am glad to see the over-the-knee boots go. I never particularly liked that look."
femalefashionadvice,"Lol. As a millennial I am laughing that flare jeans are included with examples. 😂 that if all I work in the 2000s. Girl, millennials wore this practically falling off our asses for a decade. We know what those are."
femalefashionadvice,"I'm sorry I just can't go back to what I wore in HS and feel ""modern"". The buffet proportions we wore in the 90s especially just weren't flattering then and aren't now.

I cannot stand the cropped flare or cropped wide leg jean look. I said it. It makes me have flashbacks to being the tall skinny girl with pants that didn't fit bc no one cared about tall girls when I was growing up. I brought capris into style bc I had to wear them and I hated every minute.

Why can't we just wear what we want and wear what's flattering on our bodies and everyone leave us the hell alone about it? Why do I have to care what's trendy or in/out right now? Why is anything ever ""out"" anyway? Shouldn't individually always be ""in""?

I'm 5'9"", 120lbs and 39 yo with a face that says 30-35... No kids so I have no hips so I can't wear mom jeans bc they look like riding pants on me. You know those pants with the pointy hips horseback riders wear? Not cute when it's not intentional. I just.... 🫠 Railcar and Naked &amp; Famous don't make the styles I just bought a few years ago anymore and the new cuts don't fit me ☹️.  

Now I've lost a ton of weight and my jeans don't fit without belts and are wearing out and I desperately need new ones and I'm so lost. I just want a 26/27 waist with a 33/34 inseam in a dark wash that are straight through the hips and ankle or skinny and mid/high waisted. I need dressy jeans again bc my dressy ones are too worn and aren't anymore. And big ol jinco's cut to the ankle or mid-calf just ain't that 🤷🏼‍♀️

The advice is definitely helpful but I still want to know why can't we all just wear what flatters our different bodies and call it good? Why aren't things stale because they're worn out and pilling or holey instead of what some magazine or fashion designer dictates is? Sorry for the existential crisis but I've been wondering this for a long time."
femalefashionadvice,Love my ponte pants! Thank goodness they work for me and suit my shape.
femalefashionadvice,I believe that there might be another denim drive coming in March/April. There is a BST group on Facebook for Universal Standard that might be worth searching if you need stuff now. It was just Mystery Box Season als there are likely some people looking to off load jeans.
femalefashionadvice,"I love these pictures for inspiration. Great post. For my post menopausal shape, I’ve given up most jeans altogether, in favor of ponte leggings in cool weather and wide leg lightweight cotton or linen (slightly cropped) pants in hot weather. But I love the tops, shoes, and accessories in the pics!"
femalefashionadvice,"You’re not alone. I’ve struggled with jeans for my entire life. I’m sure there’s a pair that are flattering AND comfortable AND affordable, but I had to give up the search. I can only cry in fitting rooms so many times before I admit defeat. I’m down to a capsule wardrobe and there’s no denim in it. I’m not opposed, but I just had to let that expectation go about five years ago. Maybe I’ll get lucky in a thrift store someday 🙏"
femalefashionadvice,"This post is fantastic! 

Less fantastic is how skinny jeans seem to be the only style that flatters my figure. I have been trying for years now to make the other styles work but they just look unflattering without my leg shape on show. Mom jeans are marginally ok but straight, wide, culotte, flare and mini flare styles all just erase the part of my figure that makes me feel attractive. 

Has anyone else had this issue and found ways to overcome it?"
femalefashionadvice,Seriously! It seemed like ankles were a fashion accessory for many years and any look that covered them was not fashionable.

femalefashionadvice,"I think a ‘kick flare’ Jean might be the perfect solution for you here. They’re a skinny that ends in a very slight flare at the bottom, and are typically cropped to ankle length.

femalefashionadvice,There’s not. I just have tactile issues and am at an age where I no longer “suffer” for fashion. Ain’t got time for that!
femalefashionadvice,I started doing this more because I was gifted a silver necklace I wanted to wear regularly and all a lot of my daily jewelry is gold. When I look at it purely from a color theory perspective and not old “rules” it works so well
femalefashionadvice,I think the key is to have other neutrals that it turns out can be just as useful - I’ve gotten a lot of mileage out of olive
femalefashionadvice,I’ve always put my hair in braids for things like going to the gym but recently I’ve been doing it day to day too and it’s a cute look. I’m Funny enough I think the key for me is shorter hair and a looser braid that doesn’t look severe.
femalefashionadvice,Sure it’s a fashion subreddit - a place to discuss with other people who are also into fashion. When you see someone on the street they may just not be trying to be fashionable. There may be another reason for whatever they’re weering

I don’t have time to go shopping and try on what looks best for my changed body. Comfort also needs to be at a max, my feet won’t tolerate heels anymore and even in flat shoes I NEED arch support. Would be great to see examples of silhouettes without heels."
femalefashionadvice,Where did you get those pants on the left? Love them!
femalefashionadvice,"&gt; Maybe I’m just young and stupid, but posts like these always have a flavor of hating on women for aging. Nobody makes these posts about men’s fashion, even if trends among younger men differ significantly from older men.   

I appreciate the effort that OP put into compiling her post, but there was something about the tone that I couldn't get over which was that a lot of her examples of a ""dated"" look were all of a certain type of look on a specific demographic of women when talking about a general style that has been prevalent for over 15 years. Some of this came across to me like ""You're the out-of-touch suburban mom who spends all of her time driving her kids around and is too busy to be *with* it anymore, so here's a guide for you!"" However, a lot of people still wear skinny jeans and it's not like anybody's going outside and pointing out every adult who looks like their clothes are older than 5 years. I'd go so far to even say that if anybody has bought new clothes within the past 5 years, that the cuts would have been already been updated ever to fit the new trends so if you buy skinny jeans now, but even a ""mid-rise"" is gonna be an inch higher than before and it's going to be looser through the ankle. That all being said, I do think there's a prevalent bias in society where men are allowed to age (because maturity is a valued trait in men since it is equated with stability and power) whereas youth is valued in women.    

I feel like for women, there's this awkward period between young (20s-30s) and old (60s+) where you feel like you have to look younger because you're still judged by your appearance but haven't gotten to the point where you can look ""distinguished"" and be respected for your age. A cool, oversized slouchy outfit on a 20-yo looks like an intentional statement while the same thing on a 40-yo looks slovenly and lazy because regardless of what you wear, people can still tell your age and the expectations for different ages are... different. When you're young, you really only have to worry about fitting in with your age group because any negative comments from older people can be explained with your youth. However, once you hit your 30s - people expect more out of you cause you're an *adult*, you end up in this weird spot of needing to not look ""old"" while also be put together enough so you command the respect for your age. I also think that as you get older, you don't care to suffer minor inconveniences for fashion like you can when you're younger, so the motivations also change. I hated the flapping sound of flares as I walked and constantly adjusting spaghetti strap shirts cause those straps could not stay on my shoulders the first time around, and those are just not things that I feel the need to reintroduce into my wardrobe.  

Anyway, should we not *care* about how people perceive us and just wear what we like? Sure, that sounds great and again... it works better in practice when you're young and have nothing to lose and nobody who relies on you. It's harder to practice when you're employed in a senior or management position that calls for a certain amount of professionalism (general statement that doesn't apply to everybody like those in the creative fields) or when you're at an event for your kid and have to show other parents and teachers that you're a responsible adult who has a 401k and buys organic fruit. I remember my manager at my first job talking to me about dressing more modestly and feeling the need to tone down my style after that (I was fully clothed but doing the exposed strappy bandeau thing that was popular at the time). This was probably 10 years ago and while that kind of talk may get some backlash now, those people are still working in industry and in high-level positions which affect you and how you're perceived and your career trajectory."
femalefashionadvice,"OP didn’t realize that skinny jeans are so outdated now that they’re bound to be coming back in style again soon. This is 2015 advice in 2023.

Sorry to warn you that your sensory issues will be unfashionable again /s Live it up while you can!!"
femalefashionadvice,I honestly like a more fitted jean bc I wear scrubs all day. I don’t always want to wear loose fitting/baggy clothing.  Straight leg I can get on board with but not the oversized jeans for that reason.
femalefashionadvice,This was eye opening. I wish you could take me shopping.
femalefashionadvice,"If i bought a size 27 in this jeans brand, and they fit very well trying them on but now have loosened, then it stands to reason i could buy a size 26 and it would loosen to fit better, right?"
femalefashionadvice,"We already have one extra garment rack as my boyfriend complained that my clothes were taking over... unforts we can't fit a second one in :(! 

I will check out the dry cleaner option!"
femalefashionadvice,"Set the washing machine to a low-speed spin (which reduces creasing), take them out immediately and hang to dry, smoothing out any creasing with your hands while they're still damp. To prevent storage creasing, don't fold until they're 100% dry, don't squeeze them in tight, and don't weight them down with too many other clothes."
femalefashionadvice,"Something with a lower wool content will be both cheaper and more durable. Synthetics are much tougher than wool - that's why they're used to make tarpaulins, fishing nets and so on.

You only need about 30% wool to get a woolly feel together with the insulating and wicking benefits.  Danish Endurance is a reasonably priced brand  - you can often find it even cheaper on Amazon (check the 000s of 5\* reviews)."
femalefashionadvice,"This sums up my position perfectly. 

I noticed in the 'do this"" photos for straight leg, they are a loose fitted straight - but when I put them on I look and feel like I'm in ill-fitting fat pants.  I much prefer a slimmer fit straight that fits closer to my body."

I’m looking for some summer weight merino crew socks like these Smartwool light cushion socks I have! These are 61% merino wool, nylon and spandex.

I like the breezy, thin material, and the light cushion on the bottom as I have some tight fitting hiking boots to wear these with. The trouble is, after three years of light to moderate wear, the soles are starting to thin out…

Is there any comparable sock that might be just a bit cheaper, or more durable?"
femalefashionadvice,"Yeah, same here. It's a small pouch, in my case not due to age (yet) but a family heirloom. Pretty much invisible unless I put on a bodycon dress...or high waisted trousers. Whilst I don't really care for bodycon dresses, buying trousers has not been a great joy lately -\_-"

femalefashionadvice,This seems like a good suggestion especially in a blue color
femalefashionadvice,I think steaming garments might be pretty doable. It’s kind of the shortcut to the ironing board. I think how it’s done is you hang a garment and get a steamer device that kind of looks like a vacuum with a boiler.

femalefashionadvice,"I bought myself a pair of black cotton overalls that looked like linen and I LIVED in them last year. I loved it so much that I bought myself a purple pair.

I wore them with tees, tanks, long sleeves, and I even wore crop tops for the first time since high school.

I had a rough year last year. I lost my dog, my mother, and a best friend of 20 years. On top of that I tore the meniscus in my knee and had to use a rolling walker and cane for 6 months, and I'm in perimenopause.

I loved finding something comfortable that I could adjust to my current mood. I could dress them up with a boatneck top, flats, and simple jewelry or dress all the way down with an athletic bra and tennis shoes. Plus it allowed me to cover my brace, but be able to access it in case of adjustment.

Sorry about the ramble! Thinking of aging and comfort made me think of my favorite versatile pieces and how much I'm looking forward to it being warm enough to wear them again. ☺️"
femalefashionadvice,"The issue women are having with this round of trends are they don’t flatter their body type. 90% of the images you’ve posted are of models who are below the current average size - and likely don’t represent your target audience. 

I believe in purchasing quality staples that suit your body shape and comfort level while choosing trendy accessories and shoes can achieve both an updated look while saving money and feeling positive about your image."

femalefashionadvice,"If I developed my taste in my 20s then I'd be stuck in the makeup trend that was popular in my 20s that I described above with the block brows and liquid lip.

If I developed my taste in my teens I'd have orange sparkly bronzer and black smokey eye to this day. 

The reality is sometimes people find what is trendy appealing and change their style to suit. Other times people think it's unappealing and avoid it. Whether they are teens, 20s, or older. 

There are some things in fashion today that I think look amazing and want to incorporate despite not being my usual style. There are others that I don't think look good so I won't. 

Jumping on every bandwagon just to look up to date isn't for everyone, especially knowing that it's all going to come back around again anyway. I use this sub more for inspiration- to see if things appeal to me - rather than as a to-do list to be trendy and I feel like a lot of millennials are likely using it in the same way. We don't care if younger or more fashion focused people don't like our outfit because our goal isn't impressing them, it's making ourselves feel good in our clothes. Much in the same way younger people don't care if I think their outfit doesn't look good."
femalefashionadvice,"I really appreciate your comment, and i think it is really important to talk about the reality of ageing, and the completely normal fact that what is meaningful at one point in your life will change. Younger people dress the way they do for a reason, reflecting their lifestyle, aspirations, their generation's cultural currents -  and its weird for a 48-year-old to want to copy youth culture.

But being older myself, I can tell you that it becomes incredibly easy to feel lost in fashion. Suddenly you lose the capacity to notice the various shades of difference between, say, 2016 style and 2023 style, the way I would 20 years ago. An older person can love fashion and - all age-shaming aside - being told very bluntly what might read as passé is quite helpful, especially when supplied with some suggestions like OP did. At my age I'm secure enough that I'm no longer bothered by underhanded insults about looking like a date night mom, in fact, hey, good on you date night mom for being together enough to get a sitter and get dressed up and put effort into your relationship haha."

femalefashionadvice,"Is there any way to fix halter tops from digging into my neck? I have a beautiful beaded prom dress that I thrifted. It fits me perfectly except for the fact that it has a halter that digs right into my neck fold. My bust size is 32DDD. I don’t think the problem is the band size around the bust because it fits me very well, plus I’m a little scared of altering it in that area because of the beadwork. I also don’t think I want to attach the halter straps to the back in case it cheapens the look. Is there any way to distribute pressure away from the neck without decreasing support to the bust? I’m worried if I lengthen the halter it will just make my boobs look saggier and wouldn’t solve the digging problem. The halter is two straps that are clasped at the neck with a hook."

femalefashionadvice,"Okay, here’s a quick tip from me to whoever is reading: being trendy is not the same as being stylish. If you feel attacked by this post and yet can’t fathom wearing some of the suggested products you’ve been told might possibly convince someone you’re not old (???), stick with what suits you, because suddenly switching out your beloved skinnies for flared denim isn’t going to convince anyone you’re a teenager again. You’re still a regular mom, not a cool mom.

It’s not unreasonable to criticize that someone’s magnum opus isn’t quite hitting the mark. And the whole “Well, then you do it” is such a childish retort. I have yet to write the great American novel, but I can still tell you that Nicholas Sparks writes the same maudlin cliches in every novel. I’m not a great singer, but I can also say that neither is Bob Dylan (he has other qualities). Therefore, I am not going to take my time to write up stuff anyone can look up if they fee inclined. I’m quite satisfied with my criticism."

femalefashionadvice,"One doesn’t have to hate their body to acknowledge that a trend isn’t for them. No one who has agreed with me has said they hate their body. I did say exactly that trends aren’t for everyone (meaning: if it works for you, that’s fine), as the author of this post has indicated that to wear anything but her curated cuts and styles will make one look old. As if that is such a terrible thing.

My memory goes back quite a bit longer than “pre-skinnies.” Please stop assuming the worst about your fellow elder millennials."
femalefashionadvice,"At the end of the day nobody is ripping anybody’s skinny jeans away. Wearing skinny jeans is not a violation of International Fashion Law and Anna Wintour is not going to snatch them off your body. 

If you want to be SUPER fashionable, and I mean really cutting edge, Google what Parsons students and random Berlin clubgoers are wearing. THAT is the forefront of fashion right now. Those people are at couture shows, watching designer’s moves, making clothes for fashion shoots. None of the things in this post are included in those fits, and I guarantee you if you asked a fashion student right now if cropped cardigans were cool and trendy they’d tell you no. The entire point of being trendy, cool, and stylish is exclusivity, newness, and youth. Once those trends no longer fit those labels, they’re still trends, they’re just not trendy."

femalefashionadvice,"As a nasty old millennial with cheugy skinnies, I appreciate this reply.

I haven't jumped on many of these new trends because they simply don't flatter me. Boxy blazers overwhelm my trim shape. ""Voluminous"" tops make my already wide shoulders look like a linebacker's. Boxy shoes shorten my already short legs. The godforsaken slouchy, oversized jeans trend... honestly, who are those supposed to flatter??? I cannot tell you how many of these I tried on before giving up. I found ONE pair of cropped, straight leg pants that I'd give a B+. I barely wear them. All the time I spent trying to keep up with this trend that's just ugly on me I could've spent doing literally anything else with my apparently dwindling years.

I generally love putting time into my personal style. I get compliments daily on my outfits from colleagues and the college students I engage with (and no, we don't live in a cheugy town but a major US city, so we have access to the latest trends) so I must be doing something right despite my blatant violations of this post's advice. I wear a lot of vintage, pointy-toe flats, cropped pants, Uniqlo, and *gasp* skinny jeans. With every flipping fashion trend, I take what I like and trash the rest. Lately it's been 

* High-waisted (but only 12-inch+ rises for my long torso, which are hard to find and kept me off this trend for a long time)

* Color! Lots of good color out now, especially mustard and rust. I'm done with the beige 20-teens

* Cream pants. I've always wanted these and now I have 2 pairs and would buy a third (lol per the above point against beige, I do wear them with colorful tops)

* lol is this it? It actually is. Looking in my closet, I see how few of the current trends I've adopted because they simply don't work for me.

Fashion wanes. Style is timeless. For anyone who feels the need to rewrite your look or story per the trends: Reclaim your time. If you feel good with how you look, lovely. If you don't, there are a lot of factors (mental and physical health, changing body, aging, life transitions, gender changes, new disability, etc.) that might be at play, and some wide-leg trousers aren't necessarily going to cure you. If they make you feel good, awesome! My clothes make me feel good. But they aren't these lol"
femalefashionadvice,GenXer here. (Dismayed that Millennials feel old.) Thanks for detailing every style of denim I’ve worn (and may still have some). I felt tall and powerful in the bootcut / flair jeans with tall boots back before skinnies. I’ve got muscular legs so skinny jeans never felt skinny or flattering. I felt a bit exposed. While it was a style that ruled it definitely wasn’t flattering for many. The second they were declared “dead” during Covid I was like good riddance. But agreed I’ve not found my vibe. My body is different. My job is different. My life is different. My legs are no thinner. Im liking the blousey tops though. That’s fun.

It’s unreasonable to complain because her specific advice doesn’t work  perfectly for literally everyone.

Why not make another post on how to incorporate trends for your specific body shape instead of bashing this one? OP is giving solid fashion advice on a fashion advice sub, something this sub could use more of to be honest. I honestly wonder why so many people who seemingly don’t care about fashion, have no interest in learning about it or straight up hate fashion even read this sub."

I’m still very much not a fan of the cropped look. I’m plus size and well… I’ve got big boobs and it all just feels like it is emphasizing that. Especially when a regular shirt turns crop top by me simply wearing it, there is not enough fabric to a crop top and I’m very annoyed that I can’t find nice tops. And I hate going to torrid because there’s either t-shirts or their dumb blouse in a billion prints."
femalefashionadvice,"I've started buying men's jeans the last couple of years. I can't recall what they're marketed as, but they're basically slim straight leg.

femalefashionadvice,"I’m sure you mean we’ll, but this entire post is Ill researched and I’ll considered at the absolute best. 

“Ankle boots are out!”, proceeds to show low ankle boots over and over in “do” outfits. 

“Don’t wear a slouchy bag like this!”, proceeds to show a very streamlined, structured bag.

“It’s all about the silhouette!”, proceeds to show examples of the most shapeless outfits in the entire post as “dos”.

“The new ballet flats are more dance inspired!” Shows impractical flats clearly i spired by space-gladiators and pairs with studs like a pair of cheap winter tires, with absolutely nothing “dance” inspired about the elements that separate them from old-school flats. 

“Try chunky platform shoes!”, proceeds to show a pair of moderately-ish chunky shoes that have been popular without pause since the late 90’s. 

Most of your examples of “outdated” outfits were images that were mocked mercilessly in the 00’s That is the first time I’ve seen that Katie Holmes image without the word “ugly” on a headline above it."
femalefashionadvice,"I would argue they are lol. People at my college are already abandoning straight leg. It’s all about the flare and bootcut now (yes…like early 2000s lol; I own four pairs). Mom jeans have been “out” since probably 2017. The reason why people don’t realize they’re “out” is because the entire point of the trend in jeans is to hide the cool jeans from the uncool people, aka your mom. It’s very stupid imo and it’s honestly way too much to keep up with considering how fast trends change thanks to the Internet."
femalefashionadvice,"Agree! Also it's funny that surely mom jeans are out of fashion, they came around nearly ten years ago. Soon skinny jeans will be back."
femalefashionadvice,I was just in Berlin and can vouch for the wide leg pants with either white tennis shoes like vejas or a clunky doc Martin style lace up army boot. Both are cute and super walkable!

femalefashionadvice,"I own 4 pairs of shoes and I do not care how they date me. I have a lot of foot/knee issues and go by what my podiatrist recommends and what my pocket can handle.  Shoe 1: the classic Birkenstock, shoes 2 and 3: Sanitas (more commonly known as Danskos). I've a pair of clogs and a pair of Chelsea boots.   Shoe 4 is the classic hiking boot.

I only wear skinny jeans because for the longest time, those were the only jeans I could find that had that super high waist and some stretch to them.

I've been eyeing those birkenstock clogs that have a loafer feel with the insole that won't hurt me. 20 year old me would hate the me I've become in my 30s lol"

I think I'll skip the sandals and stick with my sneakers, I haven't been able to find boots to fit my damaged foot and I've also not found flats with high arch support so the only footwear I own is sneakers and sandals. :(

I'm coming from -40 so it's going to feel tropical I think, even at night haha. I don't have any nice jackets though, just winter jackets and hoodies. I think it's clear I'm going to have to suck it up and get some clothes from this decade. 

Do you think a maxi dress and a decent cardigan would be ok? Again it would be sneakers or sandals..."
femalefashionadvice,I own a few older and cheaper pieces that probably need to be cleaned and donated. I’ve always worked in the trades until this year when I made the switch to corporate and now I feel beyond outdated with my wardrobe.

femalefashionadvice,"I’ve been pairing my skinnies with loafers lately, used to be a style I hated because I felt like it aged me but now I feel age appropriate. Your 30s are weird."
femalefashionadvice,I highly recommend platform sneakers. They look super chic and I can walk in them for days without my feet hurting. I recommend getting at least one pair a half a size big to accommodate swollen feet
femalefashionadvice,"Me too. I’m loving the straight leg styles. I don’t like wearing skinnies now because of how constricting they feel. Also, I now prefer my jeans to have at least 98% cotton content and to actually feel like how jeans were originally made to be/feel—durable, rather than like leggings. If I want leggings, I’ll wear them in non-denim form."
femalefashionadvice,I’m not saying we aren’t interested… I’m saying they aren’t new to us.
femalefashionadvice,"Pretty much anything goes in Vegas but it also very much depends on your itinerary. Are you going to nice shops/restaurants/casinos/shows? The sandals may be a bit unseasonable but maybe some nicer shoes than the sneakers - a nice boot or flat shoe would dress up either leggings or slim jeans. Ditto the tops - bring your favorite nice tops and a cardigan or two to pair with on chilly nights. You may even want a lightweight jacket if you definitely don't want to get chilled. It's the desert - it can get cold at night. For casual sight seeing, your tees and sneakers will be just fine! Final tip - drink tons of (bottled/filtered) water, even if you're not drinking alcohol! It's easy to get dehydrated af out there. Have fun!"

It’s what is most classically flattering on my middle aged frame, and it doesn’t look anti-fashion or unkempt at all. Feels pretty timeless so maybe immune to trends? I have the more current silhouettes I have been playing with when I feel like it but the slim straight jeans are my every day stand bys."
femalefashionadvice,"I honestly don’t like this post. I might be reading wayyy too deep into it, but, this has a very weird flavor of ageism. People are not “cheugy” (I have literally never heard anymore use this word outside of the Internet) or otherwise unattractive and uncool for wearing skinny jeans and a side part. 

I’m 21. Wear whatever you want. The “young people” making the trends literally do not care if you have the 2023 equivalent of a perm. To be bluntly honest (I genuinely do not intend to insult anyone): a 20 year old can tell you are not 20 if you are 40. They don’t expect you to adhere to trends set by people in their twenties. They expect you to dress differently and don’t think anything of it if you do. I realize there’s a lot of Gen Z on the Internet making fun of millennials, but the Internet is a cesspool of negativity and hate for a lot of things. 

I wear skinny jeans to class a lot because I look terrible in mom jeans or straight leg jeans. I’m short with big thighs and a square waist; they are not flattering on my body type. Dress in what makes you feel happy and confident. 

Maybe I’m just young and stupid, but posts like these always have a flavor of hating on women for aging. Nobody makes these posts about men’s fashion, even if trends among younger men differ significantly from older men. It’s always women that are the target of stuff like this, because despite it being 2023 we don’t let women age for some reason. We instead encourage women to wear clothes they don’t like, get surgical procedures, buy expensive anti-aging skincare, etc. Maybe my thoughts will change when I am older, but I really do think it’s harmful to perpetuate a belief that women need to reverse their aging to be beautiful. The wisdom and knowledge and experience that come with aging is something I admire greatly in my family and mentors. I wish we allowed the external results of that experience to be reflected without judgment and a need for change."
femalefashionadvice,"What makes you think all Elder Millennials are against non-skinny pants because we already wore them? I’m 41. Literally the Eldest Millennial. I’m interested in the trend cycling back around because I know my figure and my style way better now than I did when I was 17-24ish, so I can wear it again *without making the same mistakes I made the first time.* It feels like a fun opportunity. 

This isn’t about spending a ton of money chasing trends, either. My mom gave me her old bootcut/flared trousers. The only money I’ve spent so far is on a tailor for minor alterations."
femalefashionadvice,Sorry but the huge jeans trend sucks for people with a big butt. I hate it. Nothing about these jeans is flattering on me.
femalefashionadvice,Yes teal chevron-print peplum tops and Litas are peak timeless style glad u agree
femalefashionadvice,Sizing up makes them balloon but I'll definitely take note of the length and try seeing if higher is the answer. From the responses I'm getting the feeling that I'm bad at judging my natural waist (long torso) or I need to go even higher.
femalefashionadvice,"That's good advice, thank you! It does hit my natural waist so I'll try going higher."
femalefashionadvice,"This post irks me because this advice will be outdated in a year. 

I refuse to get caught up in trends, bc it’s a never ending cycle. I’ve started trying to focus on what colors and shapes look best or what I feel most comfortable in. 

I’m not here to look cool to todays young people. When I was young and saw older people trying to copy trends, I thought they were lame and trying hard to hold on to being young. I mean, you do you - if you love fashion and trends and have the money - do it. If not, then don’t. 

The trend for teens in my area is literally sweatpants, cropped spaghetti strap tank top, hoodie, and slides or slippers that look like Uggs. In the next season it will be something else. 

Also, I like skinny jeans bc I’m autistic and I HATE when excess fabric bunches up around me. Leggings and skinny jeans don’t cause me sensory issues. :)"
femalefashionadvice,"Okay, I get it, fashion is cyclical and that’s what keeps it fresh and interesting. But these Gen Z kids WERE NOT THERE for the early 90’s when the ONLY pants you could find were unflattering Mom Jeans or JNCOs. I’ve always hated these silhouettes, but was forced to wear them for decades. It was especially rough being plus sized; until Torrid came along I was dressing like a 45 year old Cat Lady.

When skinny jeans became a trend and widely available I was STOKED. Finally, a look that I like! And the stretchy fabric! Amazing. No one will ever be able to tell me that a tapered leg hitting at the ankle and a saggy butt is a better shape than skinny jeans.

And yes, I have literally used the “cold dead hands” phrase. Like, multiple times in the last 6 months.

Thank you for the write up; I do have a lot to think about fashion-wise… but I might just wait it out until the 90’s trend has run its course."
femalefashionadvice,"As an elder millennial, I see a lot of people who can't remember a time before skinny jeans. Even people my own age which is strange because I definitely remember them cutting their jeans to roll up back in the day. I don't think a lot of people know what looks good on them because skinny jeans were the only option for 15+ years and most of our bodies have changed pretty dramatically in that time. If you don't want to wear it, cool, this post wasn't for you. But a lot of people feel like they hate their bodies and there's something wrong with them and instead, it might actually just be the clothes and they don't know how to change it."
femalefashionadvice,Check out mountain hardwear and outdoor research pants. Made for climbing / hiking.
femalefashionadvice,"I'm a chunky apple girlie with a short waist, I'm old and I'm disabled. I can't imagine ever finding my body as a ""cool body"" and I came of age in the heroin chic era and I came out on the opposite end of the spectrum as you. I see these comments insulting bodies and clothing and it's pretty awful to see. I don't have the body of a 17 year old and I haven't for 20+ years and yet I still wear a lot of these fashions. I am thrilled to dress for my neurological conditions, for my obsession with color and loose fitting garb that won't rub all over my surgical scars, to not dress for the male gaze or in the fashion my eating-disorder-encouraging mother always dreamed, to embrace my gray hair and be grateful I'm still alive to age after what could have been a terminal illness as a teen. It's been freeing to challenge my conceptions of fashion, let alone my values. The way you talk, you can't imagine anything outside how you dress, or why we might find joy in dressing this way and that's sad. You've said some things in this comment that I hope you can reflect on and realize they are really lacking in empathy too."
femalefashionadvice,"How do folks feel about knee tears in your 30s 🤔

femalefashionadvice,"Fashion may be cyclical, but it's not _that_ cyclical. Elements of the Tumblr look are coming back, but it's pretty unlikely that the _full_ look from head-to-toe is actually going to come back. It's going to be mixed with different silhouettes, different patterns, different styling."
femalefashionadvice,dressing identically to what was trending 10 years ago isn’t timeless style though. that’s the point.
femalefashionadvice,"How about a little empathy for those of us who grew up fat during the heroin chic era, did the work to develop good relationships with our bodies, and are done hearing this nonsense from people who didn't."
femalefashionadvice,"I feel very attacked! (laganja meme). 
But in all honestly, thank you i really needed this."
femalefashionadvice,Thank you so much! I definitely like that it’s multi-colored so I can pick different colored tops to go with it. I do plan to leave the cardigan open and appreciate the suggestion to try a lighter color top underneath. Thank you again!
femalefashionadvice,You mean 10 yrs ago when this style was trendy lol?
femalefashionadvice,"Yes! Just to play of this color combo, lilac makes brown eyes pop!"
femalefashionadvice,"I’m 52 and gave up jeans altogether. Join me in beautiful, comfortable skirt land where life is uncomplicated 💕"
femalefashionadvice,I HAVE AN OWL PENDANT TOO!
femalefashionadvice,"I so appreciate the detailed approach of this post and the examples of how to be trendy. I love the lugsole boots and the thorough links to pants, etc. 

That said, I feel like all of the updates offered to fix our millennial style forget that we now have kids and bodies that reflect that. In every one of the links I clicked here, the outfit included a form-fitting or crop top on a slim person. It's hard for me personally to take any advice on tops or even pants when there are very minimal examples of trends on midsize bodies (or plus size). Separately, millennials grew up with colorful kids' clothes, layered skirts over denim, pastel skinny jeans, teal and peach chevron, etc, so the new ""neutrals only"" trend is really foreign. How do we move from this to browns and blacks only?"
femalefashionadvice,I love the tucked look but can never get it right and end up looking &amp; feeling uncomfortable. I can't figure out how everyone else seems to get it so effortless.
femalefashionadvice,Would you mind sharing where your jeans on the far right with the button fly are from?
femalefashionadvice,"Oh I definitely see a few of my wardrobe staples on this list...

I've been wanting to get into mom jeans for years but I don't know if I'm doing something wrong so I have a question: is there meant to be so much excess fabric in the crotch area? When I stand it looks baggy like a diaper and when I sit, well, it looks like a crumpled, full diaper. I've tried figuring it out by looking at some Instagram photos but I don't see many where they are sitting/the amount of excess fabric I find, so I frankly just gave up on them a few years ago. I'd like to try getting into them now because I would like something a bit more loose around the legs but still flattering, so... am I doing something wrong with mom jeans? 🥲 Please help lmao."
femalefashionadvice,"This is so timely for me, I literally just bought my first pair of Mom &amp; paperbag jeans yesterday after years and years of wearing skinnies. 

I am still struggling with tops &amp; shoes a little. I live in a really hot country so boots don't work but I refuse to wear uncomfy shoes after years of living in heels and hating it and a lot of my tops were mentioned in this guide as not to wear! Would love to see one on tops/shoes in the future."
femalefashionadvice,Oh my god this whole thing is me. Thank you so much.
femalefashionadvice,"Thank you! I'll check into these. I usually wear scrubs or business casual, so I only need like one pair."
femalefashionadvice,"&gt; on an older, chubbier person just reads as sloppy and unkempt

Yep, I admire the new looks on others but not on myself, because they send the wrong message. I kind of prefer being perceived as basic, dated and unfashionable rather than disheveled."
femalefashionadvice,"Oh hell yeah! Pants are bar III twill from macy's. Shoes are vivobarefoot minimalist boots called ""fulham"" (they are like slippers but if you're not used to minimalist footwear might take some getting used to)."
femalefashionadvice,"Yes white platform sneakers are in, especially a good idea if you'll be walking a lot.  AF1s, converse, Reebok, fila, etc. They don't have to be the super 90s youth vibe, just a thick sole."
femalefashionadvice,Yes to all of this! All of the examples for the tops in the the “do this section” had skinny women with small breasts. This post gave no examples for styling different body types.
femalefashionadvice,"Have you tried linen? It's similar to cotton but usually thinner, and can come in a variety of styles. I love my wide leg linen utility pants, and I layer them on top of thin yoga pants in the winter to stay warm."
femalefashionadvice,"Were you doing jncos? You def don't need to go that wide again. I'm 5 ft 98 lbs and wide legs look great on me bc they balance me. So, I don't think it's just being small that's the issue."
femalefashionadvice,Would you mind sharing the pants/boots combo from your middle outfit? I love it so much!
femalefashionadvice,'Mom jeans' don't work for post partum bodies??
femalefashionadvice,"Try Levi’s wedgie fit jeans. They’re mid-rise, and generous through the hips/thighs but still give shape to my postpartum lumpiness"
femalefashionadvice,That’s great to hear. I shout through text too to emphasize how happy and confident I feel.
femalefashionadvice,I know someone who has chronic knee problems post pregnancy because of this.
femalefashionadvice,"OP, casual dresses with tights/leggings and which shoes, please!! I wore this outfit a lot while pregnant because it was comfy af but I always felt frumpy."
femalefashionadvice,Yeah I’m never baring my mid riff again. Those days are long gone.
femalefashionadvice,I feel like the voluminous/oversized/boxy tops are only flattering on women with small boobs. I’m kinda chubby (thanks covid) with c cups and all the suggestions for tops look absolutely horrible on me.
femalefashionadvice,"Lol you're projecting something ugly there. 

People should wear clothes *that makes them feel good*.

I don't look at my wardrobe and want a change or fear judgement for it; I'm fucking happy! I'm comfortable and confident. *Why would I want to change*?"
femalefashionadvice,"I love my skinny jeans because they’re never too long, as I am short and have very muscular calves, thighs with large hips and butt. I just hit mid 30s and I held onto most of my favorite jeans and a few jackets from 1999-present. What I can’t fit anymore I passed on to my gen z kid. We hit up Kohl’s today for some retail therapy and I was thrilled to see the juniors section had flares that weren’t 4 inches past the sole of my foot. We racked up on a few pairs and I am excited for my flare leggings again. My style will never be for “my age”. Hoping to sport my Vans, hoodies, oversized sweaters with a crop/midi top til death. My struggle is"
femalefashionadvice,"Fantastic post, thank you!

I'm obsessed with those super square-toe ballet flats, does anyone know where to find those shoes like that for &gt;$200?"
femalefashionadvice,"Yes yes yes!! Boo to trends, yes to what is comfortable and flattering. This post does have lots of good advice for which I'm thankful, but the focus on staying ""trendy"" isn't resonating with me."
femalefashionadvice,"So I was there in January, also cannot forgo a bra and was only a bit chilly when wearing a dress with sheer tights and a leather jacket. I’m sure you will very much be fine with your usual leggings, but especially if you plan to ever go out sans seven year old a nice top and non-sneakers would be a thing I highly recommend, as some nice spots consider those things a no no"
femalefashionadvice,I wish my buttcheeks didn’t look like cucumbers in mom jeans.
femalefashionadvice,"Or I'm just... commenting my opinion....... ""criticize"" is a perfectly normal word lol"
femalefashionadvice,I went to Japan this November when there were still very few tourists and it was amazing to me how I could immediately spot the American woman because we were literally the only ones still wearing skinny jeans. And we all looked chubby and dated. I realized they were not nearly as flattering as I looked. Though I can't stop seeing the wide legged pants as way too big
femalefashionadvice,i once bought a pair of allegedly 34” inseam jeans from asos that were more like 31”.
femalefashionadvice,Exact same. Wife leg jeans or trousers are so much comfier. And I don’t really care that they don’t show off my curves in the same way.
femalefashionadvice,"I think the styling plays a big part - the long, skinny cardigan with the skinny jeans (plus maybe other dated styling like riding boots, long necklace, floppy ""boho"" hat etc) is the problem. I think a chunkier long cardigan with one of the ""newer"" pant silhouettes can still work!"
femalefashionadvice,"hate high waisted pants. i feel ugly and frumpy in them. i might be the minority but idc they also are not comfortable to me. wear what feels good and you’ll look good, imo."
femalefashionadvice,"As someone with health issues that affect my belly and how it looks, I could never comfortably wear high-waisted jeans or pants at/above my belly button. I can start the day in a size 4 and end up needing a size 10 due to bloat and ascites/edema. I have also had abdominal surgery and wearing anything on my vertical scar is uncomfortable.

So I guess I will forever be out of date in my lower-rise bottoms or wear dresses. Comfort is #1, but I always try to at least look styled."
femalefashionadvice,"I love dark grey as a neutral for the lilac/light pink/light blue in my wardrobe, especially since it can help bridge to black shoes or belts without looking like too stark a contrast."
femalefashionadvice,"I am wearing a tunic top at the moment that's probably going in the goodwill pile after &gt;.&lt; Grateful for someone saving me from obliviousness, never noticed they were in much less out"
femalefashionadvice,Criticize? You are taking this *far* too seriously.
femalefashionadvice,"I am not OP, but a few years ago I cleared out most of my (fake gold) long length necklaces. Long isn’t really on trend. Remember that you can move your favorite pendants to shorter chains. Necklace lengths from 16-20”ish inches seem to be the most popular. Stacking and mixing chain types is a big thing.

IMO most “crafty” jewelry is not really trendy right now, with the exception of very summery  and youthful items like friendship type bracelets and beaded chokers with flower beads. But tiny beaded shapes, wire wrapped beads, dichroic glass, and polymer clay look kind of dated. 

This is not a hard and fast rule, but it SEEMS like, even for fine jewelry, we’re in a phase where extra decorative elements are not really as popular. So not much filigree, pave, that kind of thing. The jewelry is either simple or statement, but in a solid shape vs lots of tiny pieces."
femalefashionadvice,"I mean, yeah jeans are the most practical for everyday wear compared to other available alternatives. What else am I supposed to wear to work that will dry quickly and can be worn with waterproof shoes? 

They just can’t drag on the ground and need to be able to be tucked into boots. So skinny, straight, or cropped are the most practical for where I live"
femalefashionadvice,"Well, that's rather rude of you to write. You may not intend it, but you come across as rather judgemental."
femalefashionadvice,Shit. All of the outdated pics actually looked fashionable to me. I’m screwed.
femalefashionadvice,"i couldn’t figure out why this post irked me but it’s this. or that we can wear these outdated items BUT we should wear them with something else that “elevates” our looks. 

the prospect of buying clothes - thrift or new - and buying stuff that fits each individual body type/shape is a process and not everything will look good on everybody. and while this post has options, it has the undertone and implication that because we’re older millennials, we need to change how we look/dress."
femalefashionadvice,Immediately donating my long thin cardigan for a chunky cropped one!!
femalefashionadvice,I’m really open to mom jeans and baggy jeans but o can’t find any that fit me! Either they are massive and fall off of me in the waist or they are so tight I can’t sit down without dying (either in the waist or the crotch or both). I need the Goldilocks jeans fit and I haven’t found it.
femalefashionadvice,Yes I can’t believe I strangled my knees and calves like that for 20 years!  Straight and wide legged jeans are so liberating! Though I hear skinnies are staging a comeback…
femalefashionadvice,Not the owl pendant :')
femalefashionadvice,"Usually it's about an inch, sometimes a little more. Depends on how wide the original hem is."
femalefashionadvice,"Because maybe they like style, and not trends."
femalefashionadvice,Agreed! But idk what to do with all my booties now 🫤
femalefashionadvice,That's true! Patterns are fun too
femalefashionadvice,"Is this really how you talk? It seems very rehearsed and corporate lol. 

That’s cool though. Do you!!"
femalefashionadvice,"Oh, they’re already making fun of us in this sub because apparently it’s outdated to not want to look frumpy. 🤷🏼‍♀️I guess we’re supposed to wear unflattering garments or risk someone assuming we’re*gasp!* old.

Jokes on them, if I had any fucks to give I wouldn’t have said what I did to begin with."
femalefashionadvice,I love this idea.  How much extra material do you think you end up with when the hem is undone?
femalefashionadvice,"Great content, a lot of work to put this together but I think this is immensely helpful to loads of people.

I gave up on skinnies a while ago but do hold onto my black high waisted skinnies for work with a tucked in blouse or bodysuit with an oversized blazer and higher ankle boots. 

Have embraced wide leg, and straight leg styles more, but it’s nice these days to have a lot of jean options that you can make work really well in your wardrobe!"
femalefashionadvice,"It is in a way which is why you guys are getting so mad I think. You’re hiding under the guise of “I don’t care what anyone thinks” when in reality we all care what each other think. That’s human nature. 

I think she’s actually afraid of making any change which is what happens usually when we turn about 25-30. We tend to get stuck in our ways."
femalefashionadvice,Bootcut jeans totally fit with today's styles.
femalefashionadvice,"Ordinarily I’d say “pick any color in there and roll from there”

But while it looks like the color in there is red not pink, I think it has enough going on that you could totally rock pink. I’d probably if you wanted something under the cardigan (unless you’re doing the buttoned up cardigan as a shirt thing) echo a lighter color that is in the skirt though, cream or pistachio or an ice blue maybe"
femalefashionadvice,"Agreed. It’s a particularly misogynistic message, too."
femalefashionadvice,"I like your attitude. I agree, I also felt comfortable in flairs and liked the style then. I am just old now and those flairs make me cold! Maybe I just need to get over it and buy some long socks.."
femalefashionadvice,"I don’t let my wide leg pants touch the ground, so I’m with you there. I’m inclined that if the rain is such an issue, then are any jeans practical? The atmospheric river has definitely got me looking at wool trousers instead, and I’ve been wearing synthetic hiking pants (which I buy from the men’s section of Costco and as such are pretty baggy) more often in the meantime"
femalefashionadvice,"This is my BIGGEST problem with the new styles - I feel frumpy and not put together. I also feel less feminine in the boxy tops and baggy jeans. I tried on a pair of jeans that were recommended to me by the sales person at Madewell and put on my boots that I had worn into the store and I looked like I was going to work at a refinery. 

On top of trying to transition out of skinnies I also have to rethink shoes ... sends me into a complete panic"
femalefashionadvice,"I went back the Goodwill to see if I could pick up the NWT top that I passed up last time, only to find it well and truly gone.  Instead, picked up a [cream and white tie dye tank](https://di2ponv0v5otw.cloudfront.net/posts/2022/08/08/62f1ce881741be1167758a01/m_wp_62f1cea0c9a228204da64540.webp) that I'd also tried and decided made sense since I don't often do light colors and it's the kind of thing I don't have to worry about messing up.  The local consignment in that town was having a sale so I also went with the fitted black and grey long sleeve I'd passed up but seemed silly not to get at $1.50. I also went to a consignment I hadn't been to in ages and found [this tank](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1868/4319/products/baby-doll-scoop-neck-tank-top_1500x1500_a4086b73-48f5-4825-b09c-6e372614fc17_700x.jpg?v=1640183443) for $6 as well as a big pair of graphic, yellow on black lightning bolt earrings. Everything's still been one in, one out, but I've accepted I'm on a top kick; most of my bottoms are newer so if I pass up something that's versatile and would be singular in my wardrobe, I'm just regret it."
femalefashionadvice,"I mean I live in the PNW and anything that can’t be tucked in so it doesn’t drag on the gross, grimy wet sidewalk is a absolute no go. Also cotton in a place that rains 3/4 of the year? Yeah, not gonna work"
femalefashionadvice,"In a lot of people’s defense, the vast majority these trends just doesn’t work for people’s bodies. Including pregnant or postpartum women; I fall into this group."
femalefashionadvice,"I hate fucking tops so much! I have a bubble butt, so pants always fit weird. Tucking clothes looks cute but I just can’t be comfortable tucking. :("
femalefashionadvice,"I agree. I'm not even a millennial and I felt like OP was Regina George telling her mom how to dress 🙄

A lot of the trendy looks are not very flattering to most people (who unironically suggests mom jeans to replace skinny jeans??) and I think it's fair to say fashion should be more about looking good/ 
feeling confident than ""wear this to fit in or we'll make fun of you"" like some high school mean girl shit."
femalefashionadvice,Where do bootcut jeans fit into the modern styles? Does anyone have strong feelings on them?
femalefashionadvice,Technically almost everything stretches while pregnant. Your ligaments actually loosen while pregnant to allow your body to handle the changes and birth. Pregnancy hormones are wild. I would sometimes get twinges around various ligaments while pregnant. Literally could feel it happening.
femalefashionadvice,That's fair - but I doubt these millenials who are *looking* to update their fashion are going to be adopting tumblr core any time soon. And yeah ballet flats are already back!
femalefashionadvice,That’s how I feel. I still see people rocking skinnies everyday - it’s not like they were being confiscated 💀
femalefashionadvice,"Hmm...I think you misunderstood me but it's also a reflection of the different place fashion has in our lives. 

I've never been willing or caring enough to make a big effort in the name of fashion, so that part of me isn't something anyone interested in the fashion industry would look up to. I'm fairly successful in my career, I fill a technical leadership role and am starting to be seen as a mentor, so people certainly ""look up"" to me for stuff. Just not my clothes. 

I actually had a job/promotion interview last week. I wore black skinny jeggings, a tunic top, a black jacket with unnecessary metal pieces on it (not blazer) that definitely is a dated look but over a 7 hour day *I never thought about my clothes*. I took my jacket off when I was warm, and I have visible tattoos. I was comfortable and happy and confident. I would not have been if I was wearing a different outfit/style. I'd have been trying to meet a standard of style that I don't recognize for myself. 

I'm the happiest I've ever been with my body and look (still lots of work to do, but I recognize the work I've done). 

I haven't given up, I've given *in* to who I feel I am and love it. 

And meanwhile, I admire and enjoy the variety of stuff in this subreddit. It's not wishful thinking, it's just fun to see!"
femalefashionadvice,How often does Universal Standard do their denim drive? I bought some awesome jeans last year and want more but can’t stomach paying $118 for jeans that might come on sale for $50 in the next few weeks or months?
femalefashionadvice,"Ohhhh my god I’ve been hunting for some not cheezy, classic enough but still trendy belts and you’ve answered my prayers with Sezane! THANK YOU!!"
femalefashionadvice,"My waist size tends to be bigger than my hip size and my best tip is to consider shopping juniors sizes. They’re often cut for narrow hips. I also have a long torso. My favorite jeans are the super high rise taper jeans from Wild Fable at Target, which is a juniors line."
femalefashionadvice,"I hate the way I look now and I feel like nothing looks good on me anymore. All weight I gain goes to my belly and nowhere else. Nothing fits right, and nothing is comfortable. It's really disheartening. Does anyone have advice?"
femalefashionadvice,"Elder millennial here who refuses to give up skinnies! I also hate the chunky combat books look, and much prefer more classic (but still trendy) look. I’ve been addicted to fun driving loafers and mules. Still compliment the look of skinnies but are not the old ballet flat."
femalefashionadvice,"If you have simple gold jewelry such as small-ish hoops, I’ve found that to help my outfits look better. For necklaces, looks like tiny pearls and small gold chains are also in. If you don’t own any, it’s kind of a good staple, anyway."
femalefashionadvice,"this was helpful! thanks. i used to be stylish and with 2 kids and 2 jobs and the world crumbling around us, i’m not sure that’s true anymore. but i appreciate this guide all the same!"
femalefashionadvice,You'd probably need one of those personal stylists that celebs and rich people use🙁 Although certain stores like Nordstrom have free personal stylists that'd be good for a single store shopping spree.
femalefashionadvice,"It’s not sad or “giving up”to not care about what others think or dressing in what makes them comfortable.

What a weird comment."
femalefashionadvice,"They literally don’t. I’m currently pregnant. Forget about tucking in anything, it’s maternity jeans time- which by the way, are really only sold in the skinny jeans cut, they know our demographic after all. 

Only thing I’ve done different is the keep the skinny jeans, wear chunky boots, and somehow try to wear cropped tops as low as possible- but with maternity jeans/trousers, that’s still a very low crop."
femalefashionadvice,"As a shorter person with a butt and thighs, wide leg pants make me look like I have fat stumps for legs. If I had longer legs, it might be okay, but the proportion never seems to look good."
femalefashionadvice,"I'm also Gen-X and I'm struggling to find resources for fashion for women my age. Everything seems aimed at under 40 and over 70.

Do you have any recommendations for finding age appropriate fashion advice for women that fall into that gap?

I started following this sub, but I've never been that trendy and mostly dress for comfort. I'd just like to know where to find good pieces that won't make me look like I'm going on a cruise for 80+ year old singles or a cougar prowling for men half my age."
femalefashionadvice,"It seems like op gave a lot of different examples so that people could decide for themselves what works for them. Boxy tees also don't work for me because of my boobs. Lot of trends don't work for me because I have too much boob. Guess what? I just ignore trends that don't work for me or that I can't wear a bra with. Like, smaller boobed people have to get dressed too and boxy stuff looks great on them. Not everything has to be for everyone."
femalefashionadvice,"I just find that mindset sad, idk. Almost as if you’ve given up. That’s absolutely not true that no one will look up to you because you’re “old”. Fashion, as I said, is always evolving and changing and I find that beautiful."
femalefashionadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/11aus4l/general_discussion_february_24_2023/j9vd8lx/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf&amp;context=3
femalefashionadvice,Skinny jeans remind me of those moms that put “live laugh love” up on their walls while wearing their wide brimmed hats and sipping Starbucks. They were super cute back in the day though.
femalefashionadvice,Yes please!
femalefashionadvice,"French tuck into high waisted pants is your friend. No more tent. 


I also found I had to update my bras for some that offer a lower, more natural shape as opposed to what is more traditional or even a regular minimizer that still has projection. That helped update my silhouette."
femalefashionadvice,"Yes. I hate feeling bulky in my pants. Skinny jeans make me look slimmer, and I love the stretch factor. I'm happy to try other styles and play with the silhouettes on top, too, but I'm not going to get rid of my skinny jeans any time soon."
femalefashionadvice,"Seconding the platform converse high-top suggestion. You won't look totally Gen Z, but it doesn't give that ""never left 2010"" vibe either."
femalefashionadvice,"Yeah, it's so spot on I'm actually mortified."
femalefashionadvice,"Yeah, I live in my ballet flats (everything in this post on what NOT to do is what I wear every day). I've been updating my jeans to get away from the skinnies, but now I have no idea what to do about shoes."
femalefashionadvice,I’m also chunkier but looked better in skinny jeans back then (high waisted). I can agree with my fellow millennials though that mom jeans are so unflattering.
femalefashionadvice,"I really would like to try mom jeans, but as a petite person I’m not sure if it would look weird on me."
femalefashionadvice,"If I like the look of jeans but despise the feeling of them (sensory) and tend to wear cotton pants like joggers, cotton dress pants, or leggings, what could I get that gives a similar vibe to jeans (like the current fashionable straight-leg or wide-leg style) without being in sensory hell? Thanks!"
femalefashionadvice,I have not related to a post this much since joining Reddit.
femalefashionadvice,Okay *this* is high -effort content. This is why I started coming to FFA 10 years ago!
femalefashionadvice,"That makes sense because you develop your personality, beliefs, and style around your teens and 20’s. That’s why it’s common for people to get stuck in the past. 

It was hard for me to give up skinny jeans too but now I don’t even look back. I think trying to see beauty in new things will benefit you long-term."
femalefashionadvice,Teuta Matoshi has fancy dresses that aren't necessarily the traditional wedding style.
femalefashionadvice,You guys did the low rise wide leg thing. Try high waisted flared leggings and jeans. Super flattering.
femalefashionadvice,"Please recommend me the perfect white shirts (or pants) that I can bleach or oxiclean back to crisp whiteness (without additional soaking). I stain my clothes even though I’m super careful. I’m tired of using specific stain removers (I have Oxiclean, Oxiclean spray, Tide spray, Tide pen) and soaking my clothes in those stain removers for up to days and the stain not coming off. I understand you need to know what kind of stain it was to know which stain remover to use, but sometimes my clothes stain and I don’t know what stained them. 

I want to be the person who wears white shirts around the house and while eating. 

I like linen but sometimes they’re a bit see through so prefer cotton or something with a tighter weave. I like form fitting stretchy fabrics. Linen is also rather pricey for me, and I prefer cotton-linen blends to plain linen since linen wrinkles so easily. 

I don’t want to wear all black everything just to avoid stains. I like some black, not all black, and not around the house. 

My size might be an issue, I’m 4’8” (26F), size 00-0/23-24” waist, 32B, so a heavy lurker of subs like r/xxs and r/petitefashionadvice, which reminds me that I should also ask my question over there… Bc of my size, I shop at stores for juniors like Abercrombie, Aritzia, Aerie, Garage, Pacsun, Princess Polly, Hollister, Cotton On or have a petite section/cropped sizing like Banana Republic, Uniqlo, Madewell, Athleta, Lululemon. 

Budget: flexible, $25-$50 per shirt? can be higher or lower. 

I’d prefer to use Oxiclean but is it even comparable to the powers of bleach? If bleaching is best, I’ll bleach."
femalefashionadvice,"As a fellow short person, I can validate you. Flares/wide legs only emphasized the width of my thighs, and I'm really nervous at the thought of trying them. I'm sure there are better brands out there, but I couldn't afford it in high school. I also have more of an hourglass figure than pear and am now postpartum, so I'm really not sure what might look good on me AND fit in the waist."
femalefashionadvice,"Keep clinging to the past then, I guess."
femalefashionadvice,"Vary the necklines making sure what your layer under the cardigan is tighter and has a turtleneck, mock neck or pretty high crew neck or standard dress shirt neck. You can do something with your sleeves too so what you're wearing under is more obvious. The open cardigan look seems to only be seen with oversized grandpa cardigans and I leave those to my kids. If I was flat chested, I might try it but I hate the way it looks with boobs."
femalefashionadvice,"We’re on the verge of tumblrcore coming back in the next 2-5 years (which includes low/mid rise skinny jeans, low profile ballet flats, tunics) so in a way it’s those elder millennials that are on the cutting edge of fashion and thus makes the whole thing kinda pointless, is how I see it."
femalefashionadvice,This is a really great post and I’d rad an write series about how to update Millennial pieces.
femalefashionadvice,Thank you! Been eyeing the Artemis belt for a while - these are great alternatives!
femalefashionadvice,"Great post.

Can you do pictures of the ""after"" as examples?"
femalefashionadvice,Exactly. I miss when this sub was more about finding your own timeless style and being immune to trends rather than trying to keep up with 18 year olds.
femalefashionadvice,"I'm just past my mid-30s, and I've been snagging jeans from the men's section of my local thrift stores. I find nice thick carpenter jeans with tons of (DEEP) pockets, nice baggy fits, dad pants, and great quality Levi's. I think they price them lower than women's too."
femalefashionadvice,"Yes, sure. The tone of the post is just too factual for me."
femalefashionadvice,Is this real?
femalefashionadvice,That was really funny 😄
femalefashionadvice,I do not miss the days where kneeling down to grab something off the bottom shelf at target meant potentially flashing my butt crack. Low rise pants are a “never again” in my book.
femalefashionadvice,Thanks! I've always loved purples and greens together.
femalefashionadvice,[Blundstones](https://www.blundstone.com/black-premium-leather-v-cut-boots-womens-style-510) are a good transition to a chunkier boot without being over the top.
femalefashionadvice,Thank you!!!
femalefashionadvice,"Thanks so much! I've really been pushing to keep things colorful, so I appreciate your comment!"
femalefashionadvice,"Both are tripping hazards, but I love them! 😂❤️"
femalefashionadvice,"I would need something close to 14"" to get there. I am generally happy with anything over 11"".  
And my natural waist is just under my rib cage, still 4-5"" from my bra line."
femalefashionadvice,"I feel you! I never had a very defined waist, but what was there is completely gone after two kids, even though I'm close to my pre-pregnancy weight. I had a manager once who swore that her shoulders got wider after birth, and I kind of didn't believe her but... Yeah. I need bigger shirts across the shoulder, in spite of my boobs actually being smaller/deflated 😂 My entire body is just wider. But yes, I also feel like high-waisted jeans just highlight the thickness of my waist and I do think the solution is a mid-rise that comes just below my natural waist. I'm long of torso though, still ymmv. A straight or wide leg also helps balance my silhouette!"
femalefashionadvice,Even my Boomer mom moved to straight legs a couple years ago. (But what she really loves is joggers. Retired woman likes her soft pants!)
femalefashionadvice,"It's the Victorian patriarchy, trying to get a gander at our ankles!!!!!"
femalefashionadvice,"Yep. Skinny jeans are ""flattering"". As in there is no bulk added anywhere. I am done trying to look skinnier by wearing tight clothing or achieving some weird trompe l'oeil. I'd rather play with interesting shapes or colour and I want my clothes to look like I made an effort instead of like I'm skinnier than I really am."
femalefashionadvice,"Yes!  I'm 39 and I never fully embraced the skinny jeans but was off wearing the 100% cotton jeans with button up fly, or a few flared styles, until those died and I could only find skinny jeans to buy.  

I'm reading this and making happy noises.  What an excellent post 😁"
femalefashionadvice,"The trick to having style is finding, over time, which trends are *you,* which bits and pieces of each passing look you feel drawn to and want to save. 

You only look really dated if you're wearing a whole outfit in a way that was very trendy about ten years back. Wearing only trendy clothes to begin with is how you end up looking dated, because being completely on trend requires new clothing every season or two. So what happens is a lot of women only follow the trends, don't put much thought into them, then in their 30s they realize they haven't been shopping in years and their whole wardrobe is hopelessly dated. 

But that's avoidable if, from the beginning, you're taking a critical look at the trends and how you really like them as they come and go, so that you can assemble your personal style. Keep the things/trends you like, like long cardigans, and eventually you'll find you have a wardrobe that's uniquely you and never quite out of style, but also never quite fully on trend, because it's yours. At that point, you can just play with whatever trends you want, and ignore those you don't."
femalefashionadvice,Thank you for this. Extremely helpful!
femalefashionadvice,I'm not actually sure they'd be comfortable - depends how stiff the sole is I think - but I'm willing to give anything a go once lol
femalefashionadvice,"People fought so hard about not wearing skinnies and sticking with bootcut. “They make people’s legs look like ice cream cones” blahblahblah. Nothing ever changes! Except pants trends. OP was very polite, great post!"
femalefashionadvice,"I’d love more advice on pairing shoes and non-skinny jeans. I bought some straight, flare and boyfriend but don’t wear them bc I’m not confident in my shoe pairing."
femalefashionadvice,Lmao I read the comment you responded to before yours and my first thought was YOU MEAN THE OWL PENDANT 😂
femalefashionadvice,"Agreed; the parent thread here was rather obnoxious. 

Like it or not, clothing is part of our identity even when we claim it's unimportant to us. Negative discussion about items we wear can feel like an attack even if it isn't. It's just human nature."
femalefashionadvice,Could you link to the other question? I couldn't find it but have the exact same question about dresses/skirts/leggings/tights!
femalefashionadvice,I’m still wearing long cardigans but with chunkier knits with buttons in the front rather than thin flowy open waterfall type cardigans.
femalefashionadvice,Omg same - I have absolutely no issues with any new cut of clothing but when it comes to new glasses I'm like thanks I like my 2016 half frame oversized wire glasses. I really should try something new.
femalefashionadvice,"I mean yeah, lol obviously I can’t make you do anything, but if you’re gonna come in here and criticize actual fashion-related advice at great length and also espouse ageist fashions views all in the same breath then seems like it must be a mad boring place for you to be, but you do you."
femalefashionadvice,"I agree that some of the tips would be outdated if you're on the cutting edge of trends...but the people looking for advice on how to update their skinny jeans are *not* on the cutting edge of trends. And high rise flares/wide leg/straight leg, while not on the knife point of trends (and notably less present in gen Z) definitely read ""standard millenial"" rather than ""hopelessly out of date millenial."""
femalefashionadvice,"Full length jeans are the more modern, trendy cut so you shouldn't have an issue. What inseam do you need for full length?"
femalefashionadvice,Incredibly helpful post. The descriptions plus different image. Examples really helped. I’d love to see anything else from your style advice column!
femalefashionadvice,I've posted [this color wheel guide](https://imgur.com/a/hdWOQn7) here before which might be helpful in general -- most outfits are from 3-4 years ago but the general point about color matching still stands.
femalefashionadvice,Then why are you on a sub that’s dedicated to fashion advice?
femalefashionadvice,"This is a fashion advice subreddit. Over and over again you will see people asking in various threads how to update their style but not knowing how. If you aren't interested in that, then that's fine. This post isn't for you. But the OP put in a ton of thought and work into this post and it's just not necessary to hop on it and declare that it's mean to give people advice on how to modernize their style."
femalefashionadvice,"Same, skinny jeans make my legs look really short (which is why I only wear them in super high rise) but wider and baggy cuts balance everything out super nicely"
femalefashionadvice,"As a person who sews, I appreciate it but probably won't! I've honestly just been leaning towards skirts/dresses more recently and when I do reach for pants that aren't jeans I usually prefer more vintage silhouettes anyway (ala 50's cigarette pants). Mom jeans and my skinnies will do fine for my casual looks."
femalefashionadvice,"And that’s totally fair! If you just like to look and read, great, I’m like that with certain things too. I just wouldn’t then turn my nose up at it and publicly declare how much I don’t care about any of it and have no interest in following it. (Not saying you’re doing this, but the commenters I’ve been replying to.)"
femalefashionadvice,"People reading them out loud made middle school me realize how cringy most texts on T-shirts are.


I bought it because I liked the font style, but after my neighbour read the stupid message on my chest I couldn't ignore it anymore."
femalefashionadvice,Short cardigans with high-waisted pants. Or tucking shirts in and wearing a shorter jacket or cardigan. Crew neck bigger sweaters are also still in
femalefashionadvice,"Looks like they got rid of it! I only had clothes in my cart when I saw the fee, but I just logged in, added the same clothes back into my cart, and the fee went away."
femalefashionadvice,"Lilac - Kelly Green! Hot pink! Deep orange! White! Light wash denim as well

Baby blue - hot pink, greys, whites, Purples"
femalefashionadvice,I have a short torso and an 11inch rise is perfect on me. It's considered mid-rise. 100% cotton jeans is where it's at and I french tuck all my tops. It makes me look 2/3 legs which my brain likes.
femalefashionadvice,Why are you in a fashion sub if you don’t care about looking fashionable/are going to feel self-conscious when people talk about what’s currently in? I’m fascinated by the comments saying this because I legit do not understand the perspective.
femalefashionadvice,Loving pointy toes sticking out of full length flare jeans being back!
femalefashionadvice,"Flared jeans and “yoga pants” were something that I wore a ton in middle and high school. They looked good on me back then, but I don’t find them to be flattering on my now chunkier body. In warmer weather, I’ve transitioned into wearing looser mom/boyfriend style jeans, but in cold weather when I’m wearing snow boots and large jackets I still think the best look is skinny jeans. In my opinion, they fit with the rest of the outfit best, are more comfortable, and I feel confident in them. And TBH, the older I get, the more that’s key in my fashion. If I don’t feel good and confident in my clothes, then what’s the point? I don’t care that much if I look “dated” as long as I feel happy."
femalefashionadvice,Omg this entire post was me. I do have many new pieces that fall in your “modern” categories but my 2008+ wardrobe is literally every dated item you listed. This was super helpful. Can you do one specifically addressing work attire (business casual)?
femalefashionadvice,"I actually really love the Gloria Vanderbilt ""Amanda"" jeans from JC Penney's! They have a misses short and regular misses in your size, but I do find they run just slightly bigger than other brands. [https://www.jcpenney.com/p/gloria-vanderbilt-womens-amanda-jeans/ppr5008285479?pTmplType=regular&amp;deptId=dept20000013&amp;urlState=%2Fg%2Fwomen%3Fbrand%3Dgloria%2Bvanderbilt%26id%3Ddept20000013&amp;productGridView=medium&amp;badge=petite&amp;cm\_re=ZB-\_-GALLERY-JEANS-\_-VN-\_-WOMENS-JEANS-\_-Gloria+Vanderbilt\_5](https://www.jcpenney.com/p/gloria-vanderbilt-womens-amanda-jeans/ppr5008285479?pTmplType=regular&amp;deptId=dept20000013&amp;urlState=%2Fg%2Fwomen%3Fbrand%3Dgloria%2Bvanderbilt%26id%3Ddept20000013&amp;productGridView=medium&amp;badge=petite&amp;cm_re=ZB-_-GALLERY-JEANS-_-VN-_-WOMENS-JEANS-_-Gloria+Vanderbilt_5)

The same brand makes other leg cuts with similar top/torso rises and cuts, but I'm not sure if they're under the ""Amanda"" name or something else."
femalefashionadvice,"Re: the updated outfits looking basic - I think squeegee posted very simple examples to not overcomplicate things for people struggling to modernize their skinny jeans. you can definitely edge up any of those looks or add all sorts of personal flare, but this post wasn't really about that?"
femalefashionadvice,I wear my wide leg crops with boots that have a shaft that goes under the pant leg. Most worn are the heeled Blundstones and Taos Crave boots.
femalefashionadvice,"Oh, it's not the length, it's the width. Any pant that widens past the thighs makes me looks shorter and frumpy because I'm so slight on top. Mermaid style skirts did the same when they were super fashionable. It's a curse."
femalefashionadvice,They don’t need to be buttoned shut! And I think a chunky thick oversized longer cardigan is much cooler than a really thin drapey one.
femalefashionadvice,I stopped skinny jeans in my rotation a while ago but I have some really nice lucky pairs back from 2016. That my 3 year old might want in 2036 when she’s 16 and all of this will be back in style again.
femalefashionadvice,"Or lug sole, for googling. 

Probably not business casual but may depend on your office."
femalefashionadvice,"I love wearing lilac or light blue with a rust or caramel brown color, [a shade like this](https://www.everlane.com/products/womens-clean-silk-ss-square-shirt-cocoa-brown?collection=womens-tops). These colors are actually sort of a staple combo in my wardrobe!"
femalefashionadvice,"I’d definitely recommend trying some wider pants and getting them tailored, you might be pleasantly surprised!"
femalefashionadvice,🤣🤣🤣 dying at that comparison
femalefashionadvice,What makes them especially practical to you? The only time I’ve ever thought this is in the rain when they’re tucked into rainboots.
femalefashionadvice,"I stopped wearing skinny jeans 6 years ago and I’ve never looked back. At first I was sceptical that I could look good in straight jeans, but I think they are soooooo much more flattering and comfortable."
femalefashionadvice,"I know. I don't mind the tapered leg or even slim straight (and I'm jealous people with more structure than me can pull off the voluminous wide leg) but I can't do the flares again. 

These days I find myself leaning towards the 1950's style of cigarette pants with looser ankles."
femalefashionadvice,Thank you for your service Squeegee. Doing the good work as usual.
femalefashionadvice,I really love that blouse on you! The pleated pants look great with it
femalefashionadvice,"Not the person you're replying to, but I'm here because it's interesting, like an art museum. I like to see what's out there, even if I'm kind of stuck in my ways. 

I'm happy with my body in skinnies so I keep wearing them but I'm happy to look at and consider other options. I am hunting for the right boot cut; I don't give a shit if I look dated, I just want to look comfortable for myself."
femalefashionadvice,"Or I can stay here and feel free to say when I disagree with a post and bond with other posters, just as you feel free to do whatever it is you do here."
femalefashionadvice,Thank you for the suggestions! Those Intentionally Blank heels are beautiful! I think I will go that route.
femalefashionadvice,"If anyone wants $20 off their first order, DM me and I’ll send you my referral code!"
femalefashionadvice,I think you’re missing the point of the post
femalefashionadvice,"Shoes are always last on my mind and it has been a sticking point when getting ready more often than not. Platform sneakers or white Adidas help, but I still feel like there's a hole"
femalefashionadvice,I'm going to do some research but keeping my skinny jeans.
femalefashionadvice,"Then you should know that designer fashion/runway trends are what trickle down to mass stores like Zara/H&amp;M. It has zero whatsoever to do with your budget. What happens at the top is what influences what happens at a normal everyday level. 

If you only want to talk personal style, I’m sure there’s a subreddit for that."
femalefashionadvice,Leggings/skinnies/tights with knee high riding boots have been a staple for me for twenty years now. I live in Minnesota and spent enough of my high school years with wet jeans from the snow. It's just practical to wear boots higher than the depth of the snow you'll be walking through.
femalefashionadvice,"I feel like most of these are very classic and can be done with different details and that none are really ""out of style"""
femalefashionadvice,"It’s advice on how to look current and fashionable *if that’s what you want.* She’s not holding anyone down and telling them what to do, she’s helping people understand what’s currently in if that’s something you value. It just happens that many people, by virtue of being in this subreddit, do."
femalefashionadvice,Yes! I have broad shoulders (which I love!) and a boxy sweater or tee just makes me look like [M. Costaud](https://www.amazon.ca/MONSIEUR-COSTAUD-COLLECTIF/dp/2012245528/ref=asc_df_2012245528/?).
femalefashionadvice,So harsh. I love it.
femalefashionadvice,Didn’t realize there was an age restriction on jeans?
femalefashionadvice,Are wide leg pants… less practical?? I find 100% cotton is way better since they don’t get baggy after a few wears and need to re-wash 😂
femalefashionadvice,I totally relate!!
femalefashionadvice,"No, they definitely fit. I just drown in the extra fabric. And as I have not changed body shape since high school, it will probably look very similar these days. If I paired something like that with something that isn't super structured, I'd just look frumpy."
femalefashionadvice,"I know this seems like a “young” brand, but try out Hollister and American Eagles flares and boot cuts. I’m 5 ft, their short sizes fit me perfect. They also offer extra short in some styles. I swear by them!"
femalefashionadvice,"Hi all! You know those [Torrid Harper georgette tops](https://www.torrid.com/product/harper-georgette-pullover-3-4-sleeve-blouse/10381277.html?dwvar_10381277_color=DEEP%20BLACK#q=HARPER%2BGEORGETTE%2BPULLOVER%2B3%2F4%2BSLEEVE%2BBLOUSE&amp;start=1)? I have a lot of tops like that... mostly cheap fabric like 100% polyester. Anyway, I'm starting an office job soon and would like to make use of what I have, but I find some of these tops to be too sheer. Others would be fine, but they're so full of static that they cling to me, which I hate. Is there any sort of basic tank or cami or shapewear that you would suggest to wear under shirts like this? I just want to make sure whatever I find doesn't make the static worse and doesn't make the shirt cling to the tank as I move around, if that makes sense. Any particular fabrics to look out for or avoid?"
femalefashionadvice,SAME!!
femalefashionadvice,"For me it's literally just not liking the way the trendier styles look. Like I can accept that other people like it, I can accept that it's considered trendy, but to me personally it doesn't look good regardless of that. Like a lot of the outfit photos OP posted as positive examples I don't think look great and so I wouldn't wear it. 

Kind of like when heavy makeup, block brows, liquid lipstick and a strip of blinding highlight was the trend. I could understand that it was in fashion and that other people thought it looked good, but I didn't agree and it wasn't for me so I never adopted any of it. I was thrilled when the trend shifted, youtubers started getting into more natural makeup, and brands started expanding their cream product selection. I remember in 2018 trying to find a cream blush in Sephora and struggling to find one. Now there's endless choice."
femalefashionadvice,"I think it’s all about what you’re accustomed to - as skinny jeans were becoming popular, they were controversial among plus sized people. 

Personally I’m midsize and carry most of my weight in my hips and thighs. All of my favorite pants now are fitted through the waist and hips, and loose in the legs. Not only are they way more comfortable than skinnies, the contrast in volume does a lot to define my waist, and I think it looks awesome! There’s always an adjustment period where you have to figure out how to adapt the trends to your own style, but I think the payoff in this case is totally worth it."
femalefashionadvice,"I feel ya, that’s what my Momma said! 🤣😂"
femalefashionadvice,Yeah…I look terrible. But every body is different!
femalefashionadvice,"I admit it's a little funny to walk into a store and see a body suit and ripped jeans that look exactly like what you wore when you were 15 and think *I already threw out this outfit....*! 

I think I'm just old, and I don't want to revisit that look for myself. I'm not the contingent that's against any of it, but it is surreal. I'm happy others are happy with it."
femalefashionadvice,Thank you for this. Amazing work
femalefashionadvice,"Overweight apple shaped woman here, I carry all my excess in my stomach. The new styles are so unflattering on my body Ive entirely given up on pants and just wear dresses."
femalefashionadvice,"Banana Republic has 36"" inseam pants"
femalefashionadvice,"Not the person you're replying to, and no one will ever look at me and think ""fashion"" and I'm 40+ but...

I feel good about my body in skinny jeans and leggings. I don't feel good in flares or wide leg, though I love a good boot cut if I can find one. I no longer *care* as much about being judged for my clothes (as much...!). I'm happy in my skinnies and band tees (mostly 25-30 year old punk bands lol) and I can start to look in a mirror and say this is me, and *I like this skin* and that's super powerful. I wish I had that when I was young. 

So what if I look ""dated""? I am dated! This look and feel in my body is who I am. 

We don't all have the same physique so while some styles adapt well to a lot of body shapes and personalities, others don't and it's ok. 

Though perhaps that means I'm not the audience for this sub at all which is a little why you may have been asking; I'm not ""into"" fashion but I really enjoy seeing the discussion and examples, almost like an art form. 

I hope that makes sense to you! 

Cheers!"
femalefashionadvice,"I agree with the idea that the 2010s trends were more formal/businessy (business casual was a whole trend in like 2015! Among young people who did not do business!) but I think that’s kind of a historical anomaly since the advent of youth fashion culture. 

I think there definitely are ways to dress these silhouettes in a more put-together way. Wearing wide-leg trousers and tucking in tops are ways I tried to make myself look more presentable 3-5 years ago while getting my first big-girl job, even before I started seeing them be incorporated into casual wear irl"

This t shirt was new, but I wanted to give it some extra style.  The entire bottom was cut off .  The ruffle was made with 1 1/2 of the banding front and the back was finished off with a scrap of fabric I had.  I'm really happy with it."
femalefashionadvice,"Flared pants look very unflattering to me on almost everyone. This is so fascinating, how different our tastes are based on our exposure."
femalefashionadvice,Wow yes as a 60+ this is a good point
femalefashionadvice,"As an elder millennial I feel the same way. I still love wearing my high waisted skinnies, but I also love that flares, wide legs and other styles are available in stores again because I really missed them!"
femalefashionadvice,"Ok, honestly?  I have thunder thighs and a big butt and wide leg jeans look great on me.  And on lots of others.  Additionally, wide leg jeans are far more slimming on me than skinnies (although that's not necessarily my main style goal)."
femalefashionadvice,The tone of this post is too factual. I’m simply just saying this is all opinion and it’s totally okay to wear what you want.
femalefashionadvice,&lt;grins in 1970s&gt;
femalefashionadvice,"We've already been there, done that lol. It doesn't feel fresh and doesn't suit everyone."
femalefashionadvice,Lol
femalefashionadvice,Wide leg crops are tricky. I wear mine with either vejas or birks (both Arizona and Boston).
femalefashionadvice,"What a fun read!  I enjoyed the low bootie/ Cheesecake factory reference!  I recently pulled out my booties and thought, huh, these look dated.. I think I'll wear them under full length, fuller styles.  I never hopped aboard the skinny jeans bandwagon,  although I have a couple pairs.  Recently, I wore cropped skinnies with some new mid calf cowboy boots and was happy with the look. //  Yeah, I'm as old as dirt, too!"

femalefashionadvice,"Combat boots are my favorite combo for flares/wide legs! Ones with a bit of a platform are most current, they’re really comfy too as long as you get a pair that’s not too heavy. 

I also love clog boots and sneakers (I like high tops, Vejas work ok too) paired with flares."

femalefashionadvice,"Is the joke about anything other than how suburban middle-aged moms and the Cheesecake Factory aren’t trendy?  Because they’re not. 

I’d be happy to say some properly negative things about people who live in the suburbs, if you need a point of comparison"
femalefashionadvice,I have slightly longer legs and have resorted to leg warmers
femalefashionadvice,Chunky loafers might be a good compromise. If you can do socks I recommend getting a pair of compression socks for your days of walking.
femalefashionadvice,"It just feels so icky to me. I've seen many fabulous stylish women in skinnies. The older you get, the more you realise following trends does not equate to being stylish"
femalefashionadvice,"I used to, but I don't anymore. However, designers/runway (and even, to a lesser extent, ready to wear) is quite far removed from most people's lifestyles and budgets, even fashionable people. Since probably most people posting on reddit aren't celebrities and supermodels, I think it's fair to say that runway fashion isn't the only female fashion worth talking about."
femalefashionadvice,If I could upvote this more than once I would
femalefashionadvice,"I'm confused. This comment is... pretty much exactly what the post already says.

&gt; You: ""She's wearing ballet flats which is back in, could be worn with flares.""

&gt; The post: ""[ballet flats] can still be passable with a more modern pants cut""

&gt; You: ""Her skinnies would work in winter especially when you're trying to tuck in pants bottoms into boots.""

&gt; The post: ""the ankle boot has also had a makeover - the shaft is higher, the heel is thicker, and the sole is chunkier [...] Knee high boots are back in style [...] swap [heeled ankle boots] out for a pair of chunky loafers or platform boot in a skinny jean outfit""

&gt; You: ""Her leopard top is timeless, could be paired with boyfriend jeans.""

&gt; The post: literally the last third of the post is about how you can just swap out skinny jeans for a different style and instantly look more up-to-date"
femalefashionadvice,"Thank you so much! I am In the grandma jeans category and I appreciate all the options! 

I would love advice about what might work if I don’t want to draw attention to my waist. My closet is full of tunics. I’ve been wearing them since nice the 1980s, never mind 2010"
femalefashionadvice,Is it possible they just… didn’t fit?
femalefashionadvice,Love how you are styling those boots!
femalefashionadvice,"I do want to finesse my wardrobe, or I wouldn't have come here, just like you wouldn't have come all the way down to the bottom of the post and unhidden the downvoted comments unless you wanted to argue.

All this advice trends very young and mainstream, which is great for some people, but I was just posting in solidarity with someone else who didn't care for the post, who remarked that they wear what they like rather than following trends and was similarly downvoted. Instead of assuming I didn't read the article and making that assertion *multiple times,* just accept that I didn't think the advice was good and move on."
femalefashionadvice,"Try straight cut jeans, I find they’re the closest to skinny jeans without being skinny jeans. And you can pair them with basically any shoe you like."
femalefashionadvice,You can look wealthy and still be poor. I don't use any expensive products or tools for my hair. I don't wear anything crazy expensive and I get more compliments in a cheap graphic t and skirt than I do wearing plain black clothes that cost me $320 in total including accessories.
femalefashionadvice,"personally i don't think skinny jeans will ever look that bad bc they imitate the actual shape of the human body. but yeah as a mid 30s i finally bought some ""new"" styles in 2021 lol. i feel like they make me look enormous and draw attention to my spare tire... but 🤷🏻‍♀️"
femalefashionadvice,"High waisted skinny jeans and ankle boots with a chunky knit still look good in winter though and I wouldn’t say “out of fashion” in any way. Young people where I live would wear that. I have a cousin who is 17 and is up to date with the trends and she wears ankle boots. I don’t think these things are universal. I’m also not in America which could be why. I totally agree that ballet flats are basically never seen now on trendy people but I don’t get the ankle boot thing, still very much worn by everyone."
femalefashionadvice,"Thanks! That was really helpful, actually! I always tried to match if with white and brown/beige and ut never looked right... The last color palette is calling my name so I will be trying it out!"
femalefashionadvice,"Yeah this is my problem. I’m not plus sized but I can’t do mom jeans. Makes my silhouette look like I’m 75% stomach. I prefer not to look like Tweedle Dee or Tweedle Dum so I guess I will have to find more modern ways to update skinny jeans. Other cuts are too narrow through the hips and don’t fit right, but sizing up means serious waist gap that I have to use a belt to awkwardly cinch. Good times."
femalefashionadvice,"Also, fwiw, what really made it clear that I was the 'star of the show' as you put it was having a matching veil, which the tailor also made for me out of a bit of light yellow tulle gathered at the top into a comb, with crystals she sewed into it to catch the light."
femalefashionadvice,"So there are two approaches to this...you can get Western-inspired belts that are less literal, but still on trend at places like [Sezane](https://www.sezane.com/us/collection/belts)

Or, you can go for true Western belts (including belt buckles here) at a place like [Shepler's](https://www.sheplers.com/womens/belts-buckles/womens-western-belts/)"
femalefashionadvice,"Skinny jeans were the hot new trend when I was in high school 15 years ago, and really only have passed out of style in the past couple years. I mean the fashionistas were wearing wide leg several years ago, but for ordinary people, skinny jeans really did stick around for 15 years."
femalefashionadvice,I feel like people fail to realize us elder millennials have done the flared jeans/yoga pants thing already. I hated skinny jeans when they came into style but I’m finding it hard to go back (although I’m trying).
femalefashionadvice,"Thanks for saying this, whew. Seeing comments ITT to the effect of, “Just gotta be REAL, ladies, the current trends look UGLY on you. You know, because of your garbage body. Remember that the purpose of dressing is to appear slimmer!” Talk about outdated. :)"
femalefashionadvice,"Lilac can be way too many shades that match all differently but some suggestions:

* Cool white and navy are both great with most tones of lilac: [palette](https://coolors.co/fffffc-c8a1d8-2c2f4f)
* High saturation lilac is good with pastel versions of adjacent colors so pastel pink or blue: [palette](https://coolors.co/ffc2ed-e894ff-b6beff)
* Muted lilac is good with similarly muted or pastel versions of opposite colors like lemon and light green: [palette](https://coolors.co/fff0cb-bc99c6-d3e6c1)

Definitely play with the color palette generator to see if you come across a combination you like. You can lock the lilac and press space bar to get randomly generated colors."
femalefashionadvice,I want to pay for an art piece when I throw bands on clothing. Why would I pay that for a blank canvas?
femalefashionadvice,"Interesting! As someone with wide hips, I've been loving the wider-legged pant styles. I feel that skinny jeans _really_ emphasized the size of my hips/butt in a way I didn't like, while wider-legged jeans offer balance that I enjoy."
femalefashionadvice,"Lol ok then, what is the point?"
femalefashionadvice,"Hi! That is definitely me. 

I'm too short and slight to do flares/wide legs again. Every photo from high school I look like a tiny child in overlarge pants. It's awful.

Thankfully my 'skinnies' have always looked more like Mom jeans, so I guess I'll still be somewhat on trend."
femalefashionadvice,I’ll definitely look into this!
femalefashionadvice,I love wearing long cardigans and will continue to do so even if some people think it makes me look old.
femalefashionadvice,I’ve definitely been thinking about getting a pair of Veja’s.
femalefashionadvice,You’re missing the point of my comment
femalefashionadvice,"It's been a while, but last I checked, traditional bridal stores like David's Bridal will carry wedding gowns in colors as well as white, though not as large a selection, of course. Worth a look, at any rate.   


I chose a pale yellow silk satin gown for my wedding dress, which I had made from a vintage vogue pattern by a local tailor."
femalefashionadvice,This is a great guide with good examples but as a 36 year old millennial mom my priority now is comfort and practicality. The feel of cropped shirts makes my skin crawl and I also can’t deal with cropped jeans except during the summer. I don’t wear heels ever and my work needs a closed toe shoe so I need pants that look ok with either ankle boots or sneakers. Skinny jeans are just easier but I’m going to try straight jeans the next time I buy jeans. Hopefully they sell ones that are full length by then.
femalefashionadvice,I am a 30 something who has been struggling to figure out how to make slight tweaks to my wardrobe to be more current. I really appreciate the time and effort you put into creating this guide and the affirmation that I can keep my favorite pieces and work in newer styles without spending a ton or trend-chasing!
femalefashionadvice,"Yeah, I don't care if I look unfashionable, frumpy and old. I'm not going out and buying a new wardrobe just because some trends have changed yet again. I like my skinny jeans, tunics, and long cardigans (and yes, some of the long cardigans are sheer). I also have several pairs of ankle boots, and those won't be getting replaced, either.

This post only made me feel really self-conscious about my entire wardrobe despite the fact that I'll need to continue to wear it. The ""trends"" mentioned here are things I would have worn 20 years ago but that no longer flatter my body."
femalefashionadvice,"Unfortunately, flared and wide leg pants aren't flattering on everyone. As a very short, petite-framed person, wide and flared leg pants make me look like a shorter version of myself playing dress up in overlarge clothing. Also, as an Elder Millennial, I've lived through the flared pants/yoga pants before in middle and high school and I hate every photo of me in them. I refuse to go back. 

Thankfully, I've never liked super tight skinnies and due to my frame most of my skinnies look closer to Mom jeans."

I am wanting to incorporate more pink and more color into my wardrobe, as well as higher quality pieces. Would a bright pink cardigan work with it? Thank you!"
femalefashionadvice,"Wow, what a great post! I’m older, and I love fashion. I know skinnies are out, but even though I still have the figure to rock trendy styles, it does match my *cough* mature *cough* face anymore 😂 I’ve been wearing straight-leg &amp; mom jeans with shorter, boxy tops. I’m trying to stay stylish without looking like something out of a Chico’s catalog. Please post more tips!"
femalefashionadvice,"Your dress and your shoes are beautiful! But I think together, they do read a bit informal. I'd pick a pair of [minimal nude heels](https://www.macys.com/shop/product/nine-west-womens-pruce-ankle-strap-block-heel-sandals?ID=4686856&amp;CategoryID=71123&amp;swatchColor=Natural%20Patent%20Tan%2FBeige) or [dressier cream ones](https://www.intentionallyblank.us/products/zodiac-1)."
femalefashionadvice,True. Maybe I’ll start with a flare or bootcut and work my way up 😂
femalefashionadvice,"Is your natural waist hitting where your rise is? I’ve found if I don’t go high enough, it does mess with my digestion and so I went even higher. Anything near my natural stomach is like a mid rise despite pitching itself as high. I always do a sit/stand/squat test in a dressing room too. The bonus of hitting my natural waist is that then I don’t need a belt which is my digestive system’s number one foe."
femalefashionadvice,Yeah admittedly that’s the guide I need too.
femalefashionadvice,"Yes, button flies for the pooch was a game changing discovery for me!"
femalefashionadvice,This is great advice. Thank you!
femalefashionadvice,I have a hard time figuring out what kind of shoes to wear with wide leg jeans.
femalefashionadvice,"My high rises have always been as close to the natural waist as I can get. I go for an insanely high rise to get there but I honestly view anything at my belly button heading towards low rise with my body setup. If it’s 10-11” rise, that’s a good start but I want it hiiiiggghhh. I’m a apple with my natural waist at the bottom of my braline but it is what it is."
femalefashionadvice,"Fantastic post. Thanks for taking the time to research and provide us with the deets. I don’t reach for my skinnies as much bc I am loving the other denim styles much more; however, I find my skinny jeans are easier to wear during the winter bc of the snow and ice. I always hated having wet pants at my ankles all day during the winter months 😟"
femalefashionadvice,What color looks good with lilac ? I never know how to make lilac look good no matter how hard I try... Same with baby blue.
femalefashionadvice,"Google ""chunky boots"" and you're sure to see that it's a category as broad as business casual."
femalefashionadvice,I’m a heavier apple with a short waist but I’ve found the opposite for me. I’m actually the biggest fan of a pure wide leg but I tend to get more compliments in a straight leg or flare. I think it’s a bit of a shock after being stuck in skinnies for a long time but I am a small booty girlie and finally I don’t have skinnies trying to curve there and point out the obvious with the butt sag.
femalefashionadvice,"Personally, I'd wear them with chunky platforms (loafers, lace up shoes etc...), a light shirt and a sweater vest. Or maybe a tight crop top."
femalefashionadvice,"I’m a huge fan, probably because I had no disposable income the first time around and now I can embrace what trends I want. Though today that means wearing a Sailor Moon sweatshirt because it’s my self designated slug day."
femalefashionadvice,Ohhh sounds wonderful!
femalefashionadvice,"Chunky boots are so foreign to me. This wouldn’t be appropriate for business casual, would it?"
femalefashionadvice,thank you for this
femalefashionadvice,"I do think a lot of the reason people feel like it’s harder to adopt a newer jeans shape is the shoes of it all. I really am not a boots person so I can’t offer advice there. I definitely found a lot of white sneakers when I was last in Europe in 2018, and that’s when I noticed the wide leg pants coming back (at least in Paris), though most were cropped. I’m also impossible at keeping white sneakers clean but I’ve found a clog fits in very nicely (just be careful on the style so you can handle cobblestones and brick streets) and I’m partial to slip on Vans where I can add my orthopedic insoles."
femalefashionadvice,"I'm 5'4 and 103lbs, so perhaps a similar build as you, and I still can't bring myself to wear my extra wide leg jeans again. 

But it looked pretty cool the first time I wore it. It was a fun, informal outing (a VR shoot-em-up game experience), so it totally fit the vibe!"
femalefashionadvice,I just recently bought some girlfriend jeans and that still feels like a big leap. I’m with ya!
femalefashionadvice,"I'm a 33 year old millennial with huge hips and butt. My late teens and my 20's I watched all my friends rock the skinny jeans trend with ballet flats, ankle boots etc, and I just never felt comfortable. I got on with it, but the last 15 years all I could see were my thighs and hips stuffed into skinny jeans that followed down to skinny ankles. 

I love the return of all these jean styles. I've been rocking flared jeans since the end of 2021 and I've felt the most confident in jeans than I have my whole adult life. The 14 year old in me who loved her early 2000's jeans is rejoicing!

I have one black pair of high waisted skinny jeans that I pair with Doc Martens. I am relived to see this is on trend!"
femalefashionadvice,"I don’t understand the hold skinny jeans have on you guys. Don’t you guys remember those ladies who kept their big 80’s hair and how outdated it made them look? Time is always evolving and that includes style.

I remember vividly from high school everyone was wearing skinny jeans and yoga pants. Can’t you just make the transition to “flared pants/yoga pants”? They’re actually a lot more flattering and comfortable than skinny jeans! I’m not quite 30 yet but I regret not making the switch sooner. My outfits actually feel cute again and not tired."
femalefashionadvice,"Square necklines and corset-y silhouettes (you’ll see tons of tops with that shape) are pretty in right now, same with lace and silk - here’s a springy [square neckline](https://www.thereformation.com/products/cora-linen-top/1312408BLK.html) top, some [lace detailing](https://www.thereformation.com/products/cristina-top/1312377BLK.html), [satin or silk is a fun texture](https://www.abercrombie.com/shop/us/p/long-sleeve-satin-button-up-shirt-49209819?categoryId=6570723&amp;seq=09), and here’s a [bustier inspired one](https://www.aritzia.com/us/en/product/duchess-bustier/106192.html?dwvar_106192_color=1274) just for some examples"
femalefashionadvice,Aritzia Little Ribbed Tee (think its their Sunday Best brand)
femalefashionadvice,"Black ofc would work but if you randomly happen to have a neon, matching them with your eyeshadow/makeup would be amazing"
femalefashionadvice,"Wear short tops under them with higher waisted pants. They dont need to show skin. Love, an Ottawan (Ottawite?)"
femalefashionadvice,"Are there high waisted jeans that are made for people with a long torso, short legs, and carry their weight in the gut instead of the butt? I feel like I need a very high rise (probably minimum 11"") for things to fit comfortably without cutting into my stomach, but because I have a thick waist and no butt, everything inevitably bags out in the thighs and hips. Wide legged styles sort of mitigate this but I'm looking for something more classic in a straight or slim fit. (I have also tried every flavour of Levi's imaginable and nothing works.)"
femalefashionadvice,Ooo those look cute !
femalefashionadvice,"This is so wonderful! 

I’m really loving those western-style belts. Anyone have any recommendations/brands they like for them?"
femalefashionadvice,"Is it? This post reads like a “Hey elderly people, this is how you be trendy, and if you still insist on wearing these horribly dated items, you’d better be doing so for ‘the camp factor.’”

Like, idgaf. Half this stuff was trendy when I was a teen so I’m pretty familiar with it, and the other half I don’t wear because *it looks like garbage on me,* and why on earth should I not acknowledge this?"
femalefashionadvice,"I want to say that these are fitting too tight at your hips. With the leg, without seeing the rest of it I can only assume it's either not as skinny of a leg as you would prefer, your leg proportions are such that they're hitting your knees instead of your thighs, or if you wanted a straighter leg then the inseam is too long so it's making it bunch up in various parts of your body. So you may want to consider trying a curvy fit to allow more space for your hips without gapping in the waist and/or a petite fit for the inseam length."
femalefashionadvice,"Can you please do a similar post on shoes?!?! I'm moving past the skinnies, but don't love the chunky combat boot and don't wear heels. Please help:)"
femalefashionadvice,"Same. I'm not super curvy, I'm under 5 feet all and only way 95 pounds (and most that weight is in the butt and thighs).

I'm lucky if I can even find pants for that fit me in my waist!"
femalefashionadvice,"And just so we're super clear here, if we are the types who WANT to follow trends, we are also going to shut up about how out of style something is unless someone asks. I know we're not mean girls, so it doesn't need to be said -- but JUST IN CASE, I am saying it."
femalefashionadvice,Size up and look for a pair that sits at your natural waist and take note of the length of the rise.
femalefashionadvice,Yes jeans inside the boots! They're way too high to cuff above (about lower-mid calf)
femalefashionadvice,"Do you tuck the skinny jeans in? Float them above? Cuff them? I have some 1) combat boots and 2) some dressier/ sleeker tall ankle boots (maybe low calf). They both go great with straight jeans, but not sure how to incorporate them with skinnies."
femalefashionadvice,If you can find something with a [lug sole or a slight platform](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/340232946851219108/) I think that often works well with slimmer pants. They balance out bulkier coats/sweaters and help avoid the ice cream cone legs look that some people don’t like with skinny jeans
femalefashionadvice,"Gen Z here… rocking the dark blue hole free stretch skinny jeans. Why? They’re SO practical! It’s one thing to be fashionable, but still totally cool to just wear normal practical clothes sometimes. I’m sure I’ll see jeans go through 90 more trend cycles in my life time and honestly, at the end of the day, jeans are jeans."
femalefashionadvice,"Completely agree! Especially long necklaces, lol. I still have one with an owl pendant. (hides face in hands)"
femalefashionadvice,"Hmm, I'll have to check those out. Do you favor any particular brand?"
femalefashionadvice,Yes I know just how to do this lol - 40 years old here
femalefashionadvice,"Great post, I'd love to see more.   
I'd also like to discuss some of the topics you raise. First off, I'm Gen X, not millennial, so I went through many many jean silhouettes before this. In the early 90s, we mostly wore a basic Mom jean/Seinfeld style. We also wore painter jeans, super wide leg house jeans, and low riding baggy style hip hop jeans. The mid 90s was dominated by bootcut jeans, but flares also gained popularity. I wore literally all of the above, except baggy jeans. I even had a rare pair of skinny jeans that were a throwback to late 70s/early 80s punk style which I wore with Docs. The 2000s were all about the low rise flares, which I loved, until skinny jeans came on the scene - of which I was an early enthusiastic adopter. I literally bought my first pair of skinnies and put all my flares away.   
Now I'm old, and I'm having trouble adopting new styles, but I'm definitely tired of skinny jeans. I think the problem for me is that I'm very short and bigger than I used to be, so all the new jean silhouettes make me look shapeless. 

One thing I noticed about the dated photos you shared vs the new ones is that the older ones do look, cuter and more put together to my eye, but they also read as ""basic"". The new photos look more contemporary, but there's almost an anti-fashion sensibility with the frayed hems and boxy silhouettes that I think look ok in the photos pictured but on an older, chubbier person just reads as sloppy and unkempt. Last fall I went out to do some errands in a new pair of mom jeans that I bought pre-frayed, and I was treated poorly by retail staff at a couple different places. I even got free food from a bakery, where I guess I was mistaken for a very poor or homeless person???"
femalefashionadvice,Damn just when I needed it thank you!!!!!
femalefashionadvice,Yeah that is a good point as well.
femalefashionadvice,[Example](https://www.ssense.com/en-us/women/product/ganni/green-city-ankle-boots/9917781)
femalefashionadvice,I noticed that too. Most of this advice is already outdated (lol high-waisted as a way to “modernize” skinny jeans when mid/low is what’s in style now). It also reads like one individual’s personal body issues/fashion preferences being prescribed to everyone as a cope. Nope nope nope.
femalefashionadvice,"You'd be surprised. As much I agree with you about revisiting styles from the late 90s and early 2000s, there's a contingent who are loudly opposed.

This post is very much for them."
femalefashionadvice,Aritzia Marlo jeans are amazing btw
femalefashionadvice,"This is fantastic! Thank you! Now do ""WTF do I do about having to go into the business for a business casual situation?"""
femalefashionadvice,"I have the exact same problem. Loose, bulky, cropped shirts kind of form a tent and make me look so much bigger than I am. I want to find the happy medium that’s trendy but doesn’t make me look like a frumpy box"
femalefashionadvice,"I think you also have to consider that if you haven’t worn anything besides skinny pants for years and years, something that looks very different on you can take time to get used to! imo it can be hard to distinguish between bad and different if you’ve worn the opposite thing for a while. 

I often have this issue when I’m trying to buy new glasses - I wear my glasses every day, 99% of the time that I see myself in a photo or a mirror I’m wearing glasses - so when I’m trying on new ones I have a hard time with the question “do I actually dislike this or am I just not used to seeing myself in different glasses”"
femalefashionadvice,Just bought something but they don't seem to have the authentication fee? is it only for bags or watches?
femalefashionadvice,And enjoy the boxy crew neck tees with no shoulder definition
femalefashionadvice,"The gnome gardener is exactly the description I’ve been looking for! I get the idea of high waisted, but it always feels like it draws attention to my worst areas"
femalefashionadvice,I think ASOS Tall has 36” inseam jeans!
femalefashionadvice,"I mean it depends, but yea a lot of pants are designed to hit the natural waist these days. 

My natural waist is on my rib cage, and I'm taller than average. So no pants are going to get there and that's fine. I dont try to make them bc it would result in a very odd crotch fit 🤷🏼‍♀️"
femalefashionadvice,"Wow! Thank you for the comprehensive list it's very helpful for those interested in having a fresh look. I think people should wear what they feel most beautiful and comfortable in, of course. Anyway, I just wanted to show my appreciation for the effort you put into this post!"
femalefashionadvice,"I love the advice, but us late 30 yr old know the newest “recycled” trends that are making their way back and — WE ARE THRILLED! It’s literally how we dressed in the  early 2000s, so we know it well and it’s like going home!"
femalefashionadvice,I just hate that boxy top look. It’s not flattering on anyone. I think it’ll age badly and look like giant shoulder pads of the 80s
femalefashionadvice,Thank you for commenting this! I'm over 6' so that's exactly what I'm looking for!
femalefashionadvice,"Have you ever followed fashion, as in designers/runway/ready to wear/as an industry? It is not as regional or opinion-based as you seem to think."
femalefashionadvice,"I think that there's so many micro trends now that what is out will be in again in a milli- second. Even lauren Conrad's outfit in the main pic looks fine and not horrendously bad. She's wearing ballet flats which is back in, could be worn with flares. Her skinnies would work in winter especially when you're trying to tuck in pants bottoms into boots. Her leopard top is timeless, could be paired with boyfriend jeans."
femalefashionadvice,This make me feel validated for my everyday style…. I think one thing that everyone should do though…is what makes you confident and feel good. This is all great advice but if you aren’t feeling the looks you will feel like you are swimming in a fabric prison.
femalefashionadvice,"I get what you’re saying since skinny jeans have been out for much longer than most people realize, but there’s a lot of people in this sub who refuse to try any other cut of jeans."
femalefashionadvice,"&gt; But the ankle boot has also had a makeover - the shaft is higher, the heel is thicker, and the sole is chunkier

Does anyone have a good example of this?"
femalefashionadvice,"Meh I have the world’s shortest torso and wear high waisted pants all the time - I prefer to think of it as my legs looking super long rather than being short waisted lol

But look for the rise measurement if you can, 11” is probably too high if you have a short torso but 10” can be good, and both are often called “high rise” depending on the style and brand"
femalefashionadvice,"Yes, I would love to read your advice on this one OP. Thanx"
femalefashionadvice,I actually FOUND them at the thrift store converted. I'll take a pic close up and post next time!
femalefashionadvice,"I think skinnies are so popular because they literally make people look skinnier by not adding any extra fabric or bulk to the silhouette. Now, you can argue that a large woman will always look large whatever the silhouette of her pants, but I think to the woman herself, she feels that she looks bigger or more shapeless in a looser cut silhouette."
femalefashionadvice,"Not according to this sub, tbh lol"
femalefashionadvice,"Why on earth are you in a fashion advice sub if you’re going to call literal *fashion advice* too serious? 

Some of y’all are being really bad sports about this, a lot of us do actually care about fashion. Hence why we’re here."
femalefashionadvice,I’ll check it out. Thanks.
femalefashionadvice,"I decided to try jeans this past fall after not wearing them for a couple years. I’m a big fan of straight leg now and can’t stand skinny jeans. After two years of leggings, skinny jeans felt super constrictive."
femalefashionadvice,"Same and same.

I do not want to emphasize MY midriff!"
femalefashionadvice,"So your point is, “they are late so they shouldn’t get to try to revamp themselves at all”? I’m sorry, that is not what most of us—especially those of us who actually work in this industry—feel at all. What a bizarrely gate-keeping comment."
femalefashionadvice,"I feel attacked, I feel insulted, and I feel like I learnt a LOT! Thank you so much for such a detailed write-up! As a new mum that needs a new wardrobe,  I'm looking forward to getting rid of some dated clothes that never even suited me to begin with!"
femalefashionadvice,Cold Canadian here guilty of the long cardigan look 😳 How are ladies staying warm and cozy without them though? The shorter cardigans I always see are buttoned shut so it doesn’t really allow for the variation of tops beneath.
femalefashionadvice,"My point is, if it takes someone 4 years to think about jumping on a trend, then what's the point of it all? The next trend will probably be skinnies again or extreme low rise, and then suddenly what's out is in."
femalefashionadvice,Who What Wear is a great source of inspiration imo
femalefashionadvice,Best top and shoes to style with [these pants](https://www.madewell.com/the-harlow-wide-leg-pant-99106853281.html) to wear in the spring time?
femalefashionadvice,"Thank you so much for this post!  Especially for the pictures.  It reminded me how much I love flares when done right and gave me a ton of inspo to shop my own closet first and then buy some new stuff to fill in the blanks.

OP are you a stylist?  Do you have a blog or insta?  Are we even allowed to ask that here lol!"
femalefashionadvice,"Absolutely. I don’t need to share my life with someone who won’t be supportive about trivial things. If they won’t, I doubt they’ll be supportive for important things."
femalefashionadvice,This was all I was thinking about with the modern jean options.  I've been wearing paperbag style pants because I'm over jeans all together for the rest of my life.  No idea how they suit other heights and sizes and I don't know where they fall on this style expert's list as far as fresh vs. dated but I'm sticking with those for the time being.  Good luck on your search!
femalefashionadvice,"Same.  As someone who’s under 5’ and not stick thin but not curvy, I haven’t been able to find a happy medium."
femalefashionadvice,"I’m getting married in June and am having the hardest time finding a dress. I didn’t make things easy for myself because I decided a long time ago that I did not want a traditional white bridal gown. I’m also a size 14 with proportions that make formal wear kind of complicated. 

I’ve been looking for brands/designers/stores that sell formal, colorful gowns and/or jumpsuits. Ideally for less than $1K. So far, I’ve checked out BHLDN, Mac Duggal, Selkie (a little too casual), Gemy Maalouf (basically obsessed but too expensive), and of course department stores. I also did consider just getting a bridesmaid dress, but I do want an outfit that makes it clear that I’m the star of the show and I don’t think bridesmaid dresses generally cut it.

Any ideas of where I should be looking? I’m very open-minded!"
femalefashionadvice,"What I've done with a few jeans that are just a little short is to just take the hem out and leave the raw edge at the bottom. You do have to press it really well after washing, it kinda likes to roll up again."
femalefashionadvice,"I've been feeling good putting my postpartum body in pleated, high waisted trousers (wide leg). So comfy, and not constricting on my tummy area, which is not only thicker now, but its bloating expansion range has widened as well 😅 for jeans, buttons flies work better than zipper over the pooch, and a loose high waisted barreled fit is kind as well.

femalefashionadvice,As a women with big butt and thighs - looking forward to looking like a lumpy paper sack with these new jean styles
femalefashionadvice,Great job! Thank you for the time and effort you put into this
femalefashionadvice,"Love this! There’s a million ways to style skinny jeans that work with current trends!! No need to throw them away, just to “keep up with the youths.” 

And there’s also a lot of fun to be had with incorporating newer styles. I’ve had a lot of fun styling my embroidered wide leg jeans and mom jeans :)"
femalefashionadvice,I want one of those subscription services to be good so bad but I’ve tried them all 😩. Cheap and overpriced. But that’s what I need! Just tell me what to buy and I’ll buy it but I just don’t have the bandwidth to figure it all out
femalefashionadvice,I bought a pair of platform converse high tops and they work perfectly for this exact scenario!
femalefashionadvice,What I've been doing for backless and strapless is 1) reusable nip covers and 2) athletic tape to shape. Stick on bras have been unreliable for me.
femalefashionadvice,Awesome! Do you recommend any brands or styles from a brand?
femalefashionadvice,I think it’s more about dressing for your body than anything else. Baggy tunics were also bad for me. At least more jeans options means more ways to dress for your body.
femalefashionadvice,I gave up all my skinnies a couple of years ago but picked up a pair from a thrift store the other day for old times sake and they're SO uncomfortable lol. I like not having to fight to get my jeans on and off around my feet with wide legs and flairs
femalefashionadvice,This entire post basically grabbed me by the scruff of my neck and dragged me across the pavement
femalefashionadvice,"The seam detail takes it out of preppy for me -- that's a very trendy finish in a way that doesn't scream ""my daughter will be unearthing this from my storage bins"". Whoever said this is asking for a schoolgirl skirt is right. It's deconstructed schoolgirl chic."
femalefashionadvice,It’s really interesting how for boys’ 🤣
femalefashionadvice,"This is great. 

Death to skinny jeans (I don't understand the obsession!) I remember when they came in style and so many people were like 'you'll take these boot cut jeans out of my cold dead hands' and they ended up wearing skinnies. And now they're saying the same about skinnies now. Exhausting. 

Like we don't HAVE to follow trends, but many of us WANT to. So let's just follow the trends if we want to and everyone who wants to wear old clothes can do so and be quiet about it?"
femalefashionadvice,Agreed! I’ve already moved past skinnies in the last 5 years but this post still gave me new ideas to try.
femalefashionadvice,I feel like I spent 2010-2021 with exposed ankles whether I wanted them or not and finally last year I was freed from the tyranny. I have a nerve condition activated by the cold and getting full length pants back has changed my mobility so much.
femalefashionadvice,"This is all just opinion. Wear what you want y’all. I haven’t worn skinny jeans in years, but it’s simply not that serious. 

Also, 

&gt;When the pants style changes (every 15 to 20 years)

What? More like 3-7 years. It doesn’t take that long for trends to change."
femalefashionadvice,"ok wow, that blouse really looks like it was tailor made for you!"
femalefashionadvice,Check out Charly Goss for personal shopping
femalefashionadvice,"Some of y’all really need to learn to be comfortable with not liking the dominant style without insulting bodies, yours or others."
femalefashionadvice,HOLY CRAP I did not see this post coming and lucky I had just poured a cup of tea becuase this is a sit down read. THANK YOU for writing this. I am exactly the person who needed this information. I knew there was a change happening but I didn’t know where to dive into it. Thank you thank you for making this guide. Do you have a blog or something for us mere mortals to hang on to your every piece of fashion advice??
femalefashionadvice,I’m with you on the jeans issue. I’m an apple shape plus size. Nothing but skinny jeans looks good or fits properly around the waist. I do go for the high waisted skinny jeans by default because the few brands that cater to the plus size market on Aus default to high rise style to smooth the belly out.
femalefashionadvice,"Thanks for this post!

Re: tunic tops— what I find pretty funny is that, when I entered the work world ~10 years ago, it didn’t even OCCUR to me to tuck my tops (let alone tuck my t-shirts outside of work). I wore my tunic-style blouses over skinny/ slim work pants, every single damn day. Now I see tucking all the time and it looks so much classier! Just a plain t-shirt tucked looks almost acceptable for a casual workplace. It’s pretty funny to me now something so simple never even crossed this millennial’s mind."
femalefashionadvice,I definitely jumped off skinny jeans once options hit the market in 2018 but the average woman in my age group and city is still wearing them and then complaining they look out of style with their wardrobe. This post is trying to reach those people and tell them there’s another way.
femalefashionadvice,"Echoing the love for your color combo in #1—I never would’ve thought to pair those two, but it’s seriously fantastic!"
femalefashionadvice,"I would try a medium in tall sizing, if you can find it."
femalefashionadvice,Does anyone else get stomach cramps with high waists? I love the look but for some reason my digestive system does not.
femalefashionadvice,Luckily this post is full of options and you don’t need to describe a look as being garbage on yourself or others to dislike it.
femalefashionadvice,"Very true on all counts, skirts are fun and a lot more comfortable than pants. Plus, even if weight were to change significantly, it's much easier to adjust a waistband than an entire garment. I have some body size fluctuation as well particularly at the waist, in my case due to a variety of stomach problems. I'm looking into creating a few [wrapper dresses](https://www.laughingmoonmercantile.com/product-page/118-download-wrapper-work-dress-or-morning-gown-1840-1860) for summer, because they are fairly loose other than a belted waist and I could create an adjustable belt."
femalefashionadvice,"This is me right now! I took an afternoon to go to madewell and just try things on. Still came home with high waisted skinny jeans, but at least they’re the right size now 😂"
femalefashionadvice,"I love this post, thank you so much. Now, how to send it to my dear friend who is stuck in 2012 without seeming rude…"
femalefashionadvice,"This clears up SO much for me. I emerged out of the pandemic utterly lost as far as style. I was always forward-thinking in fashion and could sort of predict new trends. All the sudden EVERYTHING was new, and I was completely overwhelmed about where to even start. I’ve recently been researching different elements of modern style (imagine, I have to RESEARCH modern style 😬 . Gasp.) Here it all is so clear and laid out plainly. A full guide. I was so confused about ankle boots and am SO relieved to finally know. 

I have a vintage light purple long and boxy sweater that I put out to be donated, and I’m going to take it out and try a front tuck. I still have not successfully found a pair of jeans. I am living Jean-less as I refuse to wear skinny jeans and be outdated. I’m experimenting with leggings looks and will be relieved to move into shorts weather. Shorts are so predictable.

You elucidated all the elements that are confusing, and I feel I have a precise guide to the modern silhouette. I also couldn’t articulate before that the changing silhouette is what has changed everything around and made everything need to be redone.

You even explained the thin cardigan that’s sitting in my closet that I’m now CERTAIN needs to be donated. 

Many, many blessings! MORE PLEASE."
femalefashionadvice,"Lol I hate everything in the ""do this instead"" examples! I'm going to rot in my boring old fashioned styles foreverrrr!"
femalefashionadvice,Uhhh.. google why you should ALWAYS wash clothing before wearing and then you’ll feel much differently 😅
femalefashionadvice,This is amazing! As a millennial it’s hard to keep up with today’s trends. This post is a life saver. Thank you so much!
femalefashionadvice,Thank you! Great suggestions ♥️ I have both so will give them a try.
femalefashionadvice,"This write up seems to be for women who maybe are in a rut and don’t know how to adapt to their new styles.  Listen, I work in fashion planning specifically at a luxury denim brand, but even I wouldn’t patronizingly say “wow, so late! I was doing this AGES ago!” because at the end of the day, fashion is a rolling wave that hits its peaks at different times and places. OP wrote this for other people, not just for you."
femalefashionadvice,"Ooh wow what a great post!  I've actually been thinking about my skinny jeans a lot and making a post that was sort of in defense of skinny jeans but also looking for tips in keeping them updated through styling and I think you touched on a lot of great things here.  

I think a key take away when wearing a more cropped or ankle length skinny is to only do so when you're a wearing a sandal or strappy heeled shoe that exposes a lot of foot otherwise it can look awkward.  Or you can always just cover the bottom of the jeans with a chunky boot,  problem solved.

The only thing I will push back on from the ""don't do this"" section is #1.  I think a lot of people would say those outfits could be ""fixed"" by wearing a high-rise skinny instead.  But as a woman in her 30's living in a post pandemic world I am done wearing clothes that aren't completely comfortable and high rise skinnies that is you.  I have a pair that I'll pull out for a special occasion in the evening but a full day getting my stomach squeezed non-stop is just too much!  While the tuck into the mid-rise can create a long torso effect, you can't tell me the boxy cardigan is doing the torso any favors either.

Personally I'm not on a journey to look trendy.  That's an never-ending treadmill that I don't have the time, money, or energy for.  I think we'll look back on looks like the volumious top example and wonder what we were thinking.  Most millennials at this point have developed a sense of their personal style and what works for them.  So my advise to everyone is to forget what is trendy but on what is classic and what fits you and your life style.

Lastly I'd like to talk about the two reasons why of all the fashions we grew up with we are still hanging on to skinnies?  FirstlLike I already mentioned comfort is a big part of it.  Skinnies have more elastin then any other jean and that makes them softer.  Many of these other styles require a more strachy and stiff material and frankly I don't want that touching my skin.  Second they are flattering.  They aren't changing the shape of your leg or your proportions.  While not everyone is completely proportional working against your proportions is often a losing battle and embracing your natural shape is often most flattering."
femalefashionadvice,If only they were actually “extra” long! For example 20 years ago a tall inseam was often 36” now it’s 32”-34” and it’s infuriating!
femalefashionadvice,This is perfect for Paramore. I'd wear it with flat lug sole comvat or Chelsea boots.

femalefashionadvice,Fashion doesn't have to refer to current fashion. Fashion varies by age. That's why different retailers cater to different demographics.
femalefashionadvice,"Yeah I do it all the time, they lend well to each other tbh. Rescue Heros/Bratz vibes. I like the calf high versions best with skinny jeans"
femalefashionadvice,I just don’t wear jeans anymore now that I’m in my late thirties.
femalefashionadvice,Or just roll and cuff em yourself! I cuff jeans all the time just for the sake of variety
femalefashionadvice,I feel like there is some sort of ankle conspiracy because I've also found it really difficult to find women's work shoes that are meant to be worn with socks so it's like the fashion police have decreed that women must expose their ankles in the work place at times.
femalefashionadvice,"I could imagine a crisp white shirt and jeans, but it depends on what's in your closet. I could see a fresh face and neat hair being good for photos if any get taken."
femalefashionadvice,"I’m loving all the new pant styles but struggling with shoes.  I hate the way my feet look in flats and also feel like a wide leg or flare looks best when paired with a heel.   I do have a few pairs of the chunkier low boots but they feel so clunky in anything other than a skinny leg.  
I have a trip to Paris/London coming up and have no idea what kind of shoe to pair these wider leg bottom jeans/pants to that will still be comfortable after days of walking.  I’m over 50 and like to stay current without going overboard."
femalefashionadvice,OPs advice is 4 years too late.
femalefashionadvice,I appreciate this as a 32 year old with no fashion sense. I’m okay getting away from skinny jeans but I struggle with what shoes to wear with what style of jeans/pants. Any tips?
femalefashionadvice,"Love love love, thank you!"
femalefashionadvice,"Umm I stepped away from skinny jeans 4 years ago. This write up is 4 years too late. 

It's going to cycle back to skinny jeans in the next couple of years, plus low rise is starting to come back as I'm seeing 18 year olds with jeans from my youth."
femalefashionadvice,This is so helpful! Thank you!
femalefashionadvice,Not what I said. “Adapt and evolve” != “match everyone else”.
femalefashionadvice,Thank you ☺️
femalefashionadvice,"I am in the same boat entirely. I feel like I need someone to go shopping with me and help me find up to date outfits that suit my body.

Also, how would these styles work during pregnancy?"
femalefashionadvice,"Same. I know this is the trendy look but I just don't like it, and it would look absolutely terrible on me."
femalefashionadvice,"fashion isn't the same thing as getting made fun of for a hobby though. Fashion is on your body. The body isn't neutral, as much as we might wish it was. Every body part has loads of cultural /beauty standard messaging tied to it (you should be thinner, bigger boobs, you should be trying to slim down this area and increase this area and do you have weird hip lines? Does your back look strange compared to hers? Does this shirt make your boobs look too far away from your collarbone? And a million other specific little body worries.) 

So an insult or even just a comment that lands like an insult regarding what you're wearing, can hit in a very visceral place, especially if you had felt really good in the outfit (makes you think your ability to judge what looks cute is off kilter bc how did you love this and other ppl read it as Big Bird) or if you felt a little unsure about it (you were right, shouldn't have worn it, why bother trying new silhouettes, they'll always look weird on me.) 

I'm very glad you're able to be confident despite people airing their unwanted opinions- I try to be that too! I had older brothers growing up and ohh man did they put me thru my paces lol. But I 100% understand why these comments hit so hard and relate, even though I wish I didn't."
femalefashionadvice,Really helpful post and strong Gilmore Gurls reference username 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
femalefashionadvice,"I was just commiserating with the other downvoted poster. What is ""currently in fashion"" is also an opinion, and one which is highly regional."
femalefashionadvice,"I guess you missed the multiple paragraphs about how continuing to wear what you like being fine, and if that's the case then the post probably isn't for you?

Idk I guess I just don't get why someone would read an entire, very long post about updating their look, if that's not what they want to do. When it explicitly says, if you don't want to update your look, this post is not really for you and keep on keeping on as you are."
femalefashionadvice,"No, I read it, but I don't find it helpful. There is never just one trend silhouette and only one: there's lots of takes for lots of types of bodies. I just found the post a bit single-minded, and not in line with my taste or my body type.

If you honestly think people should not wear what they love I don't know what else to say to you."
femalefashionadvice,"I'm (45F) going to Las Vegas end of March (with my 7 yr old), it will be warm but not hot. I get cold very easily. Do I bring cardigans? Sweatshirts? Hoodies (I only have zip up ones)? Are sneakers ok or should I have sandals? Are slim cut jeans ok? Plain leggings? 

I am also short (5'2""), fat and cannot forego a bra. My usual style is leggings, graphic T's and sneakers but I also almost never go anywhere nice. I have some nice tops I can maybe pair with leggings??

Thank you for any help you can give me."
femalefashionadvice,"It's not requisite by any means. If it was necessary to change and adapt your style to match everyone else, there would be no trends.

There are men today who find it stylish and quirky (or whatever their deal is) to dress in very old suits, many women especially in the plus-size community still hang onto the voluptuous vintage pinup look complete with the pin curls. I don't think a sound argument could be made that people like that aren't invested in fashion; it's just not what a modern young instagrammer is wearing."
femalefashionadvice,"Right?! It just confuses me bc I see extremely thin women pull off this look, but on me it looks like I’m swimming in the clothes 🤷🏼‍♀️"
femalefashionadvice,"If you’re into altering, fake cuffs is a handy way to tailor too-short jeans"
femalefashionadvice," Once, skinny jeans and ankle boots were the power couple of the early 2010s, now it’s just what middle-aged moms wear out to date night at Cheesecake Factory. And there’s nothing wrong with any of that!  

I'll admit I laughed at that, but it's also kind of passive aggressive in a way I'm seeing pop up all the time. You know what you did. You made a joke about the suburban mom of a certain age, class, and location - the joke implies we don't want to be this person. And saying ""there's nothing wrong with that!"" after doesn't undo it. Just own the message, if you're going to say it."
femalefashionadvice,"Such a good guide on how to update the look without having to completely give up skinnies. I do think the silhouette looks nice and paired with a more modern top and boots like you've suggested is a good compromise. 

Having said that, once I started wearing looser fits I never looked back. It's SO much more comfortable. Bonus is feeling more like I'm dressing for myself than the male gaze. 

I'm not buying any wide leg jeans (I think that silhouette for trousers will probably have more longevity) but I love straight leg and generally baggy fit jeans. They're not particularly in trend but not outdated like a skinny which is also a good compromise for folks who aren't used to the idea of wide leg jeans."
femalefashionadvice,Also keeping my everlane market tote.

femalefashionadvice,"This is very good analysis and (most importantly) respectfuly written ""wear this/not list"" type post I've seen in a long time. Subreddit wiki worthy. Well done, OP!"
femalefashionadvice,"My partner is awesome and randomly got me this a few months back after I said it looked cool.
I'm yet to actually wear it because I don't know how to style it, but next month I'm going to see Paramore so want to wear it there.
Does anyone have any advice on how to style it for then or generally?

femalefashionadvice,Thank you so much!
femalefashionadvice,Wowooww I feel so attacked but also like this is the intervention I needed 😩
femalefashionadvice,I think I've heard people say their ribcages spread out during pregnancy!
femalefashionadvice,"Yeah, every single comment I've read for the past 7 or so years about how flattering high rise jeans are has made me scratch my head. I don't even have much lower belly pooch--but I definitely have some b/c I'm old AF--and that expanse of zipper over it makes it look so much more apparent. Belted mid rise jeans make it go away."
femalefashionadvice,"I have short-ish legs and have the opposite problem, where a lot of flares and wide-legs are too long and can only be worn with very chunky shoes that have a bit of a platform, etc. Otherwise, the hem will drag on the ground like we did with JNCO's in the late 90s, and I'm not into the wet, muddy, frayed hem look or tripping over the front of my pants. I don't object to wearing chunky boots sometimes, but jeans that *can't* be worn with running shoes or flip flops when I'm just going to the grocery store aren't something that can be a staple in my wardrobe. The ones I have that do this are already ""short"" length, and I'm average height, at 5'5. And if you hem flares, it changes the shape so they're less flared.

I do think that cropped flares look at least as bad though, and if the ""tall"" or ""long"" lengths aren't long enough to work for you, then tailoring isn't even an option!"
femalefashionadvice,"I’m petite as well, and skinny jeans tend to be more flattering than these wide leg styles. I end up looking lost in my jeans/frumpy."
femalefashionadvice,Then why are you in a fashion sub?
femalefashionadvice,Lmao you’re 31! No way you’re decrepit haha
femalefashionadvice,"I agree with this, but double check the rise on each  jean from Madwell. Some of the high rise vintage straight washes have an 11” rise, and some have a little more than that, which ends up being too high for me."
femalefashionadvice,"I'm a plus size (18w) and 5'0 and I cannot find jeans except skinny that look decent and fit well. I LOVE wide leg trousers and a sweater, but finding decent jeans that fit are wretched."
femalefashionadvice,"I remember slightly pre-Covid going to the mall bc I needed work pants for an event that week, and I literally could not find pants that covered my ankles"
femalefashionadvice,Cold dead hands are correct!
femalefashionadvice,I absolutely love your combo of purple and chartreuse

femalefashionadvice,"This post is amazing, thank you"
femalefashionadvice,What is your background?
femalefashionadvice,There are many of us boomers who have evolved. Can't believe your mom still gets a perm!
femalefashionadvice,"This is absolutely spot on 100%. Thank you so much for putting it together!! 🫶🏻

I’d love to see one for shoes, especially everyday shoes that aren’t heels, and how to pair them with bottoms!!"
femalefashionadvice,"I mean, this is a sub about women's fashion, and skinny jeans and tunic tops aren't in fashion anymore. OP was just articulating what is currently in fashion and how to update a wardrobe if you want to integrate pieces like skinny jeans. I feel like every post in a fashion sub is going to incorporate opinions - what else would people post about?"
femalefashionadvice,Thank you!  I painted a quite a few of the art pieces behind me so that means a lot.  :)
femalefashionadvice,Thank you for this post! Looking forward to more similar ones soon hopefully 🤞
femalefashionadvice,"I've been playing with some new pant styles, and absolutely love the variety that they offer. I recently got a pair of wid(er) legged black denim that I got hemmed so that they are cropped, and I think they look really good with heels, but strange with flats. Are there some do's and don'ts with wide leg cropped pants?

Thank you for putting the time together for this! I still have a couple of pair of skinny jeans that I've been wearing sometimes, and this gives me ideas for how to do so in a more modern way. (I really like the dark denim + combat boot combo that I've been doing)"
femalefashionadvice,Thanks! It's a tiny bit big one me.  I'm thinking about taking in the waist and adding some pockets.
femalefashionadvice,"Thank you, a well-written and inspiring post.

One thing I don't understand about high-waisted pants: Are they really supposed to fit at a natural waist?

I have a long torso and naturally prefer a higher rise. All my skinnies always have been ""high rise"". Which means fitting just under my belly button.  
More modern high rise (mom jeans etc.) fits at my belly button (which is still good three inches under my natural waist), and it looks better, I think. I also have ultra high rise cargos that fit a little bit above the belly button. Then I have flare jeans that go even higher but so high waist doesn't look balanced to me anymore, there is a too big block of fabric between the crotch and the waistline.  
I do like skirts that fit at the actual natural waist but I think they are different because they hide the crotch and basically correct the long torso thing.

Models in online shops never have supposedly high-waisted pants at their natural waist. Always somewhere around the belly button."
femalefashionadvice,Did you read the post at all or stop in the first few paragraph? Literally the entire thing is about how to update your look while *not* dressing like a teenager...
femalefashionadvice,"🤩🤩🤩 love that Renaissance look with the futuristic Docs. Perfect, no notes!"
femalefashionadvice,"Dude we are always on the same page, this is a fantastic post and guide - also cackling that I literally wore high waisted skinny jeans with platform combat boots, a tucked in cropped sweater and western belt yesterday. I AM THE GUIDE."
femalefashionadvice,"I like all of these, but I especially love how perfectly that first top complements the gorgeous tattoo on your upper arm."
femalefashionadvice,That denim skirt is sleek and sexy as hell. Not a trace of sisterwife vibe! I’m
femalefashionadvice,"Thank you for this! I’m in my late 30s and have always been rly into fashion but I feel like my jeans game is off. I bought several pairs of mom jeans last year but they look ridiculous on me and I cannot for the life of me find anything besides skinny jeans that are flattering on me. I’m 5’6 and around 110bs so not crazy skinny, but I feel like any oversized pants just look ridiculous."
femalefashionadvice,"Same! 
But I still do - albeit rarely - indulge in wearing skinny jeans with wide leg knee-high heeled boots."
femalefashionadvice,Your style is so fun and distinctive! Love all the embroidered and colorful touches. Great art collection as well.
femalefashionadvice,These are so fun! Love to see the different ways you styled that skirt.
femalefashionadvice,"But isn’t it a requisite part of personal style to adapt and evolve it over time? My mom dresses completely differently than she did even 20 years ago, much less than how she did as a young adult"
femalefashionadvice,"This. I remember struggling with this so much last time. It's harder this time around because I've put on weight as I've aged. I absolutely hate a flare or wide leg that hangs 4"" off the ground."
femalefashionadvice,Love all of those looks. Your attention to detail and fit shines!
femalefashionadvice,Looooove your bold colors! Really fun looks.
femalefashionadvice,"Thank you so much for this. As a petite woman with large breasts, the whole boxy cut fad makes me look like a frumpy trash bag. Also I’ve seen maybe 2 people that are able to pull off mom jeans. They look awful on 99% of people. Please make it stop."
femalefashionadvice,wheres does everyone get white baby tees/ crop tops that aint see through?? :)
femalefashionadvice,"Nice! I like the clean lines and how you mix colors and neutrals. Great boots, also! 🤩"
femalefashionadvice,Five?
femalefashionadvice,"Hi! Not sure if this is the right place to ask but I'm a 32 y/o male with waist measurement 31, hips measurement 40, and inseam 32. I want to wear women's workout/yoga leggings (some brands I know are Lululemon, athleta, Nike, under armour) for hiit and yoga workouts. I wanted to know what brand would be best for a male for those two types of exercises and what sizes I should start with trying on when i go to the stores."
femalefashionadvice,Tall sizing and/or Long and Extra Long inseams are the answer to your issue!
femalefashionadvice,"Thank you, this was a phenomenal write up. The photos were especially helpful. 

Any suggestions from OP or the crowd on incorporating chunky boots with skinny jeans? My low cut ankle boots unconsciously migrated their way to the back of my closet several months ago, so at least I’ve got that going for me."
femalefashionadvice,"u/jsqdressesforwork has great suggestions for targeting your style; I’d like to add that I also spend $100 to $400 per item though secondhand because that’s how I afford quality materials and quality construction that have good resale potential (though I also donate). 

Shoes are another matter. I will spend a lot because taking care of your feet has lifelong benefits and I strongly believe that shoes make an outfit."
femalefashionadvice,Yeah I cringed at those purple ballet flats. Wtf 😂
femalefashionadvice,Thank you for your sartorial services 🫡
femalefashionadvice,"Uh, no, just like most people don't really leave the popular style they experienced during their teens and twenties when most people spend time developing their personal style. My mom still wears a perm blowout even though the 80s was forty years ago."
femalefashionadvice,I hear thisssss I’m technically a 30” inseam but it looks like I’m in high-waters once I put shoes on and a 32” inseam is too long and I simply can’t swing getting all my pants hemmed 1” or somewhere in between.
femalefashionadvice,"Yeah, I kind of felt like this whole post is way too much opinion.

There's also something to be said about older people dressing like modern teens. I know we've all seen a woman in her 50s wearing A&amp;F hiphugger jeans in the mid aughts and went *???????*"
femalefashionadvice,I needed this! Thank you!
femalefashionadvice,"&gt; It's just that liking clothes and liking fashion trends are entirely different.

I mean, to be fair, it's called femalefashionadvice and not femaleclothesadvice. Fashion does have a lot to do with trends, which makes this post fairly relevant."
femalefashionadvice,I picked up a few printed blouses in b&amp;w from Nordstrom. I'm still figuring out color but at least I found some pattern to start playing with.
femalefashionadvice,"This was a fantastic, helpful read! I’m stuck here too, and I’d love to see you cover other topics you’re interested in. I can’t wait to learn more!"
femalefashionadvice,"Interesting re belting. I have a rounder stomach and what really emphasizes it are the high waisted trousers (which makes me feel like [a gnome gardener](https://tse3.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.jm22MBtW3YakaK_Ok3o6mgAAAA&amp;pid=Api)). Belted low/mid rise trousers, on the other hand, de-emphasise it. I thought the opposite would be the case but there you go. 

  
Also: stoked to hear full-length hems are in because it's been sheer hell trying to buy trousers for some years now. I even went full tinfoil mode and complained that businesses were trying to save on fabric at my expense : )"
femalefashionadvice,"While I have no problem with the dress itself, a beaded cape or a shawl over the shoulders will reveal less, if you wanted to wear it.

I think it would be good to consider the specific tastes of the bride and groom, for example a political family would differ from reality tv stars, etc."
femalefashionadvice,"Keep your boxy tee shirts, they look like garbage on me…and a lot of people, quite frankly.

Just because a cut is trendy doesn’t mean it’s for everyone."
femalefashionadvice,"I make my own wish bracelets with gemstones for anxiety and other ailments :) 
Super minimal and dainty with many different types of stone combos. I researched the crap out of what works or not, element wise etc."
femalefashionadvice,"Out of genuine curiosity, why are you in a fashion sub then? It's somewhat inherently about ""what's in""."
femalefashionadvice,It was - thank you so much!! 🥰
femalefashionadvice,"Not preppy, it's too busy for that. It's going to be difficult to styles because the top part is schoolgirl-prim, but the bottom part is far more casual. I would pair with loose fitting navy trousers or a long flowy white skirt, depending on your style and physique."
femalefashionadvice,"This is genuine female fashion advice.  As a millennial who still owns (and loves) skinnies, thank you."
femalefashionadvice,What specifically do you love about skinny jeans and tunic tops and waterfall cardigans and Tory Burch ballet flats? /gen Is it just a coincidence that the trends from 10-15 years ago align exactly with your personal style in a vacuum?
femalefashionadvice,"I appreciate this post! I’ve kept a pair of skinnies but I’m definitely on the wide leg and flare train. I honestly hate the feeling of my legs in skinny jeans now, like they’re in sausage casings."
femalefashionadvice,"I need a post on incorporating older accessories into a more modern wardrobe. I find it easier to update staple pieces but then I age myself with my jewelry because I haven't really updated anything in over a decade. I don't wear a lot of jewelry but when I do, I feel like it can make or break an outfit."
femalefashionadvice,I’m so glad to be rid of my skinny jeans. Just too constricting. Loving all sorts of wide leg and slim flares.
femalefashionadvice,Thank you!! I am definitely in need of rebooting my 2010 look but it just suits my shape and body so well! I’ll adapt
femalefashionadvice,"“Snagging” 

Ex: Quit snagging my buzz! I like this shirt."
femalefashionadvice,The trompe l’ oiel for short torsoed people is mid-rise. Who’s to know the whether the jeans are labeled high rise? It’s like how short people buy crops for full length pants that don’t require hemming. Might take a lot of trying on of clothes (ugh) but a successful fit is out there somewhere.
femalefashionadvice,"Mid-rise. It's not the mid-rise of 2006 (honestly I don’t even think we had mid-rise). I still feel like it's fairly high-waisted, just not as much so."
femalefashionadvice,This is so well-sourced. Love your photo examples — I’m now obsessed with those ballet flats with the little nubbins on the soles
femalefashionadvice,I thought of this thread immediately when I watched [this video](https://www.instagram.com/reel/CnerToHOWYM/?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y=)
femalefashionadvice,"I love this, and thank you for the ""cold dead hands"" comment so we don't have to see everyone else say it. As a millennial, I used to love skinny jeans more than anything, but since I switched over to other cuts last summer... I cannot imagine being in them again."
femalefashionadvice,"Wow...you're an editorial fashion genius. I found myself stuck and trying to update with brighter colors. I looked at my closet and all of a sudden it was mostly beige, black, and white. The jeans were a huge must! I found this so helpful...thank you so much for taking the time to write this. 

Can you do one with examples of edgy tops? I'm not into ruffles...especially ruffled sleeves. Maybe selection of t's or what kind of cuts/necklines?"
femalefashionadvice,"I recently went from a retail position where I was walking 5+ miles every day to a WFH position where I can wear comfy pants all day every day. I also worked in the same shopping center as an absolutely amazing discount clothing store and bought a lot of jeans. Brand new jeans for $12 or less when your jeans are functionally a consumable is a hard prospect to pass on, and I didn't expect the store to last so I stocked up while I had the chance.

I plan on donating the extras now that jeans are no longer short-lived consumables or everyday wear for me; I'm just struggling with how many pairs I ought to keep. I've already gone through round one of the culling; turns out the Kondo method doesn't work if your threshold for *sparking joy* is too low, and I still have ten pairs of comfortable dark-wash blue jeans that aren't too worn out and fit me well. That seems a bit excessive.

How the hell do I decide how many are *worth* keeping? I'm not planning on going capsule wardrobe minimalist here-- I like having options-- but ten pairs of rather similar jeans seems a bit excessive."
femalefashionadvice,I appreciate your reply though :) thank you.
femalefashionadvice,"I would recommend modanisa which is a site from turkey that has a lot of really cute modest fashion. They have a lot of tunics and cute long skirts, etc. They used to be so-so with shipping but recently I think since they're more popular in the US now they're really great with shipping and returns."
femalefashionadvice,I am this millennial.  Please send help!
femalefashionadvice,"They can rip my ballet flats from me. Those new ones linked in the post look so ugly, I’m sorry. Maybe I’ll end up like that woman with the blue eye shadow lol but I’ll love it"
femalefashionadvice,This post is an absolute masterpiece. Thank you for your hard work. It was also a joy to read.
femalefashionadvice,This was really fun to read. I still have a delicious pair of skinnies but now I have new ideas what to do with it. I’d love to hear more about boots and ballet flats if you ever do another of these?
femalefashionadvice,This is seriously so good.
femalefashionadvice,"If you're serious about having style then you have to put in some time to develop an eye for things you like. Be it using Instagram, looking at Pinterest (not recommended without already having a sense of style), checking new arrivals at Net a Porter/Ssense/Moda Operandi several times every week, etc. You have to look at lots of stuff in many different corners of fashion so that you know what you like and what those styles have in common. And then you have to also spend time actually trying stuff on to figure out what works for you personally or not.

I think I spend more than the average for FFA, usually spend $100-400 on each piece and sometimes go up to above 1000 for special items (coats, fancy designs, bags, etc). Probably average out to 1-2 items per month although sometimes I buy like 6 things and don't shop for the following 4 months. I actively avoid spending less than 100 on knitted items bc the quality tends to be low and tbh would recommend most people with reasonable income to do the same."
femalefashionadvice,"Me, an elder millennial with tired old style plus a postpartum body like 👁️👄👁️  

I think where I struggle is I just .. don’t understand my body any more. Like, high waisted skinny jeans don’t look good on me because my torso is short so they go way up high but also I’m somehow thicker after the baby. I weigh the same as I did prepregnancy but I’m… thicker in the waist. So what little defined waist there is gets filled in by the denim of the high waist.   

But then what do I tuck my primordial pouch into if not high waisted jeans ? I love my body and I’m not ashamed of it but I just feel kind of out of place.   

This is super helpful, gonna go back to reading about mom jeans 🥹"
femalefashionadvice,I never listen or care what's in. I wear what I love.
femalefashionadvice,"See, the problem is that I really love a flare or boot cut but I have long legs and the jeans typically end up too short. I hate it when there's a huge gap between the bottom of the jeans and the ground. I hate it on myself and on other people. To me it reads like someone wearing clothes they've outgrown - juvenile rather than fresh and youthful."
femalefashionadvice,Yes! And Jeggings!!!
femalefashionadvice,"I really like these two boutiques [Avenue Tucson](https://avenuetucson.com/collections/tops) and [Dear Society](https://dearsocietyshop.com/collections/apparel/tops). They're pretty trendy but not overly so, more like on the casual side of trendy, and prices vary since they're boutiques. Can't comment on quality of everything since that also depends on the specific brand, but I like them for a more casual but ""I put in some effort"" level look. Avenue stocks a lot of Agolde which is a denim brand but also is really good for minimal relatively fashionable tops to wear with jeans.

All else failing go to Abercrombie. Turns out they now have stuff fit for adults that are cute. Quality isn't top but you won't be paying that much either."
femalefashionadvice,What a lot of work you did between the analysis and assembling the photo examples; I’m sure a lot of people will find this very helpful. Thank you!
femalefashionadvice,"I think this is preppy, though maybe more like what's called ""light academia"" now - try searching that on pinterest for style inspo"
femalefashionadvice,thanks! I haven't checked out Abercrombie since their revamp!
femalefashionadvice,I love this! Thank you for taking the time to put it together.
femalefashionadvice,"BIG fan of the green skirt, I'd definitely say it's worth keeping. such a lovely color and fit"
femalefashionadvice,"I will still not be giving up my skinny jeans anytime soon, but I want to thank you for the incredibly well researched post. This is what makes me keep coming back to this sub, even though I am a 30-something fashion disaster. :)"
femalefashionadvice,Oh no haha! Time for a trip to Vermont or Seattle!
femalefashionadvice,Ah shoot. I wish they never left canada😥
femalefashionadvice,"I will look that up. I'm not worried about bare leg feeling so much as I am with there not being a ton of room for more layers underneath, and not being confident that it won't itch right through another layer just like it does with the lining."
femalefashionadvice,"I wear stuff like that sometimes. I call it my butch chic phase (i'm queer). But I'm aiming for more feminine stuff these days since the rest of me is aging and looking kinda... decrepit. 

Anyway, thanks for your help!"
femalefashionadvice,"I bought, in 2022:
-3 pairs yoga pants
-2 Activewear tops
-4 Sweaters
-2 pairs wool pants
-2 pairs cotton pants
-2 cotton blouses
-2 slips
-3 pairs shoes
-I think one skirt, but I own many already

That's 18 items of clothing. With shoes (3) it's 21. That's not counting the underwear, long underwear, stockings, or anything else, though - that would bring the total closer to 30."

femalefashionadvice,"In that case and depending on the whether, I’d probably do one of those linen sets from Abercrombie. Basically a beige blazer, high waisted pants, white bodysuit or tshirt. I feel like it’s formal enough to present, but not stiff."
femalefashionadvice,"Not very preppy, more like a modern natural minimalist style to my eyes. I think it would go well with cropped wide pants (tapered or untapered) in an unstructured cotton/linen fabric basically like [this fit](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0012/1074/4887/products/DSC4164_4fd5b858-b846-4f83-a20a-f5fced2d87b5_1512x.jpg?v=1673336033). This with wide pants is kind of not really a young person style so if you're younger you might want to try with a schoolgirl style pleated mini skirt in a natural fabric."
femalefashionadvice,I like BabyGold.com if you want something reliable you can order online.
femalefashionadvice,"Ugh that’s for sure. I’m in Jersey and today I woke up with frost on the yard and earlier in the week I didn’t feel much like I needed a coat! 

Love the ballet flat resurgence, so cute"
femalefashionadvice,"I buy very few items—as in, I've not bought anything (other than some socks) for the last two years. When I do buy something, I spend quite a lot and usually buy second-hand or custom-made. Rather than having a massive pile of mediocre things, I have a few excellent, distinctive items that I truly love and want to wear all the time. And actually well-made things can be worn over and over and over for years before they are replaced.

My wardrobe is a few mix and match outfits per weather season (maximum 4 bottoms and 6-8 tops, usually less). I have an active life and wear things intensely, so after a few seasons or years they get replaced, so nothing ever is too far out of fashion. But mostly, I try to have STYLE, not follow trends or be in fashion. Style is personal."
femalefashionadvice,Could try a knit shrug/bolero that cuts off above your chest if you're ok with looking very trendy. Big and slim sleeves would both work. Or maybe tie a knitted scarf around your shoulders like [this](http://www.tasaram.com/images/scarf-tying-guide-evening-styles-off-the-shoulder.gif) but this would still be kind of cold.
femalefashionadvice,"Best bet is to buy dyeable shoes if you want an exact match, yeah."
femalefashionadvice,"Thanks for the suggestion, and your right things deff photograph differently.  In ordered a pair off Amazon that were completely off. I think taking the dress with me is my best bet."
femalefashionadvice,I would wear a half slip!
femalefashionadvice,"My favorite date night fit right now would be like, knee high lugsole chelsea boots, sweater skirt or miniskirt, Artizia bodysuit, and a trucker jacket"
femalefashionadvice,It’s kind of a cross between dark leaning clean girl / elevated basics and dark Americana / motorcycle babe 🦅
femalefashionadvice,Aerie
femalefashionadvice,Yeah this is a horrible company all around it’s a total sham I still have got nothing from them in near 2 months I have fake tracking numbers I literally got sent here from a cashapp boost so figured it was safe
femalefashionadvice,"Cool, thank you. Out of curiosity, what's your aesthetic?"
femalefashionadvice,"I think that shoulder bags are back in full force. Baguette bags have been having a moment for a while now, as well as crescent moon shaped bags which are popping up all over."
femalefashionadvice,"Hmmmm ok! We’re similar ages but very different styles. I would get date night tops from Abercrombie and Artizia, but I think those might not hit your boho style. So maybe like Free People and Anthro and you could look at Old Navy too? But honestly this is not coming from lived experience on my part. You might be a good candidate for a Nuuly subscription bc that’s the Anthro / FP subscription service."
femalefashionadvice,also where can i buy a good pair of leather pants
femalefashionadvice,"US (DC region), 31, like to dress cute (?) - I know that's not helpful, but I don't actually know the terms for a lot of these styles. I waffle between witchy / bohemian, but more low key. not a ton of makeup, but statement pieces that I can pair with jeans and boots.

femalefashionadvice,"I feel stupid because despite knowing that wool tends to make me itchy, I recently bought a wool pencil skirts, thinking that the satin lining would protect me from feeling the wool on my legs. Unfortunately, it does not, and it feels like a thousand tiny prickles all up and down my thighs. Short wearing something else under the skirt (bike shorts, tights, etc) is there anything i can do to make the skirt less...prickly?"
femalefashionadvice,"The cut is a too boxy to be preppy. I’d wear it with a pair of slim white slacks, untucked."
femalefashionadvice,"I'm not sure it's possible to find online, just because things will photograph differently. You might be able to narrow the field, though, then bing your dress to the store with you. Otherwise, yes, you can dye silk or satin shoes.

femalefashionadvice,"Hi, Minneapolitan  here :)   


I agree with u/golfcartwalrus. Knee length or a bit shorter dress would work really well. The typical ""no white or close to white"" applies as always. Sounds like it might be an indoor/outdoor wedding? I would do maybe a chunky heel. You don't want to dig into the grass in stilettos :)"
femalefashionadvice,"Very interesting with the last few pics (Eight), where  you styled the skirt two ways. That's very cool! Coincidentally I saw something similar on a B Jones Style video on Youtube, last year. I'm inspired to try out those concepts and do what you did!"

Why donate the dark neutral oversized cotton sweater if I'm just going to replace it with a different dark neutral oversized cotton sweater? It's not objectively tired (faded, worn); I'm just tired of it. Solution is probably just not to wear it for a year or two, at which point it's like, oh! new sweater! to my reptile brain."

After feeling uninspired last week, I’ve been feeling much more able to put together looks I love after some reading/Instagram deep dives. 

[Album!](https://imgur.com/a/Bmr8oWh)

[One -](https://imgur.com/a/0LAEaCG) Included the inspo where I saw this tan red combo and absolutely loved it. Red has been something that’s been huge and I’ve been enjoying, so pulled back out this red turtleneck to wear with everything. 

[Two -](https://imgur.com/a/ahBN7IF) See love of red above. 

[Three -](https://imgur.com/a/MklUMjD) Bad angle but decided to go more fitted instead of everything oversized. Stretchy things are so comfy. 

[Four -](https://imgur.com/a/Lq71m9F) Apparently this is what you wear when it’s Coney Island for Hot Dogs in the morning on the freezing beach and Michelin restaurants at night. Did a ton of walking but was sad to see the wear to my silk socks at the end of the day. Top is a shoulder padded tank which is a easy throw on. 

[Five -](https://imgur.com/a/FQQxJ42) Easy weekend throw on. 

[Six -](https://imgur.com/a/NHjmH3p) Playing with this white can really be the strong “color” contrast sometimes vs a true neutral. Wish I had picked just the shoes or just the bag, but it was raining and the shoes were for practicality. 

[Seven -](https://imgur.com/a/QWFwSjH) I love yellow. This shirt has a kind of weird kind of cool sculpted sleeve. It’s huge. 

[Eight -](https://imgur.com/a/kcPp3dg) And last off, some variations on a theme from a very versatile skirt. For daytime, I picked the loafers and wore it up as a knee length dress with a monochrome shirt underneath(took off the lumpy lacy bra underneath for a better look). Then for evening, my so and I went to another Michelin restaurant, so I took the opportunity to pull it down as the skirt and pull out my cream heels. I love these shoes and don’t have much chance to wear them, even if they make me slow walking from the subway. 

CCW always!"

Hello!  I hope everyone is having a good weekend!  

Here are some outfits from this week as well as a couple from earlier in the month that I missed last time.  It's been a bit sunnier out so I've needed a hat and found myself reaching for the black wool Stetson cowboy hat my partner got me a couple years back.  I think it works?  CCW

[playing with menswear](https://i.imgur.com/maWPqFy.jpg)| I've basically been living in these old wayfarers.

femalefashionadvice,Sewing a button that popped off a pristine Gucci leather blazer I got off eBay (iirc) for a great price.
femalefashionadvice,I love that sarong style skirt. It will definitely work with all your black and white tops!
femalefashionadvice,With polka dots!

Would you say this top is preppy style? And how to style it WITHOUT jeans? Chinos? Smart trouser? Do I tuck in cause the layered shirt is supposed to be sticking out, isn't it?"
femalefashionadvice,Just got a sleeveless high necked rib knit sweater the other day but I wasn’t sure what I could wear over it to keep from getting cold that wouldn’t make it feel “top heavy” or clunky?
femalefashionadvice,Great idea to give your “on the fence to donate” items another wear before making a decision.
femalefashionadvice,"It's cute, maybe do a leather trouser and a boot, or a pleated silver skirt and heels"
femalefashionadvice,"I think it’s going to be a very practical purchase. Like many women, I already have silk(y) black and white button ups and plain tees so dressing it up or down should be a snap. Example: white tee + skirt + sandal = casual. Black silk blouse + skirt + slingback heels = dressier. And I already have a different scale polka dot blouse for a less dramatic version of pattern mixing."
femalefashionadvice,"I've been looking for some too. Aerie just released a bodysuit with the trim so keep an eye on them as I suspect they'll release regular tanks soon.

I have one from C'est Moi that i got last summer but not sure they're still selling them. Plus they have limited sizing options."
femalefashionadvice,"They were sold separately, (link to [bra here,](https://corset-story.com/products/pour-moi-alex-padded-plunge-bra-black), link to [top here](https://corset-story.com/products/ada-black-lace-cropped-top-with-deep-v-neckline)) and are even from different brands. But I did choose lacey things so that they would mesh well together, even a lace corset (I've just been struggling to lace it up so I didn't wear it that day lol)"
femalefashionadvice,"I did the same thing, but I leaned into it with bright red lipstick and my naturally pale face, lol."

I’ve been searching for a white or off white tank top like the old Abercrombie tank tops. Wither scoop neck or v neck with the lace trim on top. Unfortunately everything is either shiny/wrong material or way too much lace or Shein. Anyone have any recommendations?"

[wfh but cute on thursday](https://i.imgur.com/mYirYgJ.jpg) was rolling with some new stuff, vintage miu miu shoes I tracked down for cheap made me so happy

[out for a casual dinner](https://i.imgur.com/G0dy2aD.jpg) wasn’t ready to let go of the shoes yet, but [here](https://i.imgur.com/6tcJDgN.jpg) is with outerwear. Really digging the scarf thing lately. 

[Gallery night at a friends](https://i.imgur.com/CUrBhIF.jpg) ended up not getting the dress code memo because my friend has never hosted before, so really glad I leaned into the fancy in fancy casual, felt really cute in this and it is actually a skort! Cheap off Amazon, but dug it out of my closet doing a bit of a clean and decided to give her a chance

[Mall yesterday](https://i.imgur.com/kEkUEQg.jpg) reallllly need to clean my converse, but overall felt comfy and coordinated in this, and got loads of compliments on the matching green situation. Also found some super cute stuff while shopping so a double win for the day

femalefashionadvice,"Same advice from me. 
I ordered their fleece leggings. They did come but were weirdly not stretchy or comfortable and didn't fit. When I emailed to return them they offered me a 30% refund and said I could keep the leggings. Leggings I don't want and can't wear. I'm in a days long back and forth with them now. I said I'd take a 75% refund or else I wanted to return them. In their last email they said they'd give me 50% off or send me another pair but that they don't do full refunds. That last email apologized for sending the wrong product, which was not my issue and imo is a case where the receiver should definitely be getting a 100% refund. Wtf? They also try to make you feel bad and accept their deal by mentioning the environmental impact of returns."

femalefashionadvice,What are your favorite sheer black tights that don’t run. The last time I wore stuff like that I believe they were called pantyhose
femalefashionadvice,"I think the biggest issue making it stray from black-tie dress code is the slit. Typically black tie dresses are long and very formal looking (so like nothing with cut outs.)

If you really love the dress then I would think about the hosts (if they’re very formal/conservative then that’s different from people who maybe want to encourage their friends and family to dress up and have some fun with it.) if it’s more of the latter or if this is like your close friends wedding then there’s probably a little leeway."

femalefashionadvice,Leather leggings and edgy boots
femalefashionadvice,"Start on Pinterest (which yes I know is so 2010) or google image search for Muslim business casual. Start aggregating what speaks to you, I suspect you’ll see pieces repeated in several of the looks, start by buying that piece in high quality (Poshmark or thrift) then use fast fashion to try out the other pieces until you start finding your style. 

I always recommend Stylebook as an app to help turn your closet into inspiration pieces. Much easier to do when you are starting out than to try and upload all your pieces into the app at once"

femalefashionadvice,"You are a bit unhinged eh.. I don’t have a holier than thou attitude you just need to stop telling people what to wear like your opinion is the only one. 

As it happens I genuinely don’t judge people, it’s uncommon for autistic people to be judgey. It’s not a generalisation, there’s a high percentage of lgbtq+, high empathy and distinct lack of judgement of fellow humans. 

I get Botox because I like looking young so what? I don’t look at old people and think eww. Honestly the main reason I got it was for ease of make up application as I was sick of concealer sinking into my fine lines.

I’m English and no I’ve never heard of ponte pants it doesn’t mean I know nothing of fashion. For all you know they’re called something else here or they’re just not worn by anyone I know. I did Google them and came to two conclusions, they look like leggings and you have some weird obsession with them."
femalefashionadvice,"Let me begin by saying that I have the fashion sense of an ant. I’m terrible at telling if a dress is formal or casual or too revealing for the occasion.

I’m going to a black tie wedding as a guest in early April, and so I wandered into a Macy’s recently and found this dress, which I guess I didn’t initially find too revealing (nor did the friend I had with me, who I hoped would dissuade me from making poor choices.) When I got home, my husband (who quite possibly has more common sense than I do,) said it was far too revealing for a formal black tie event. Is this dress alright, or should I return it and resume my search?

femalefashionadvice,"This happened to my husband once. He had a favorite sweater that was comfortable and nice enough for work on Fridays (this was pre-COVID). He   wore it to work on Fridays. And then one day, his coworker said something complimentary about his Friday Sweater, and the fact he unintentionally called it the Friday Sweater killed that sweater for my husband 😂"

I think I know what you mean….is the weird bump from a seam? If so you may be able to very carefully trim excess fabric (without cutting into stickers that hold the seam) and do some ironing to get things to lie more flat."

femalefashionadvice,"All the time. I’ve gotten rid of so many clothes over the years, and still lament the loss of a number of them! I have been grateful when they or an approximate version of them materializes back in my life. For one of them - a long pencil skirt, a close replica of which I was able to procure a decade after I donated the first one - reappeared after I purchased the replacement. I had bought the first skirt from a charity shop in my early 20s, donated it back, regretted it for a decade, years later found and bought a second skirt very similar to the first. Amazingly, about a year after that second purchase, the first skirt showed up back in the same charity shop and you know what? It was a lot nicer in my memory-the reality was it would have been a little too dated for me to wear with 100% confidence. So I actually upgraded and that was nice to realize instead of being mired in nostalgia."

The closest options to what I like are the Nike dri-fit running pants/shorts which feel and look great (though rip my wallet, and the clothes' durability since I wear the same pair all the time.) 

Are there any brands that do the women's equivalent to men's gym shorts? Or perhaps something similar to Nike's dri fit bottoms?"
