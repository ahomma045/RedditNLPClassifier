No. Sure, women were in classy dresses and men were in suits and tuxes of blues, greys, and navy, but imo that’s a traditional extension of formality.

malefashionadvice,"Yeah for sure. To borrow a biology term, to me the chunky derby/loafer is almost a case of divergent evolution between the business “comfort shoe” of older corporate drones and the Doc Marten of the counterculture. 

I definitely find it interesting that the loafer or derby with a chunky practical *boot* sole is the height of fashion, but the loafer or derby with a chunky practical *sneaker* sole is considered the lamest thing ever. Personally I think they’re both ugly, but I have to concede the boot sole is less ugly. 

Ironically, the only way to truly set yourself apart from the Rockport is to go *even chunkier*! That’s the only way to really express that your chunky shoe is a fashion statement, and it is not chunky because you have the feet of a 50 year old. You can also go the other way, and get a “comfort shoe” that is stealthier than the Rockport, but at that point you aren’t really participating in the chunky trend.

malefashionadvice,"Right, but in Canada, you expect winter and know what it's going to be like and how long it's going to last. Los Angeles typically has about 6 weeks of ""winter"", during December and January. During which it will be in the mid 50s Fahrenheit and rain approximately 3 times. 

We do not have boots. We do not have coats. We do not have enough winter clothes like flannels, sweaters, base layers, wool socks, hats, scarves, etc. to make more than a couple of outfits. And we typically don't buy that stuff in ways that are meant to hold up to heavy use. I don't spend money on winter clothes I'll wear 3-4 times a year, and which will go out of style long before they wear out.

malefashionadvice,"&gt;What do you think?

I think it doesn’t make you look buff, it just looks like you’re wearing a sweatshirt

&gt;I've been treated way nicer by people when I wear this top as compared to only wearing a simple half-sleeved T-shirt, for instance.

This is in your head, you’ve decided that people treat others better if they’re fit to the point that you’ve developed an actual issue around it, you’ve found something that you think fixes that, and you’re reaffirming it to yourself while wearing it. I can guarantee this is mot happening at anywhere near a significant enough degree to go through all this trouble over, and your hypotheses, people generally do not have much of an issue with people being slightly slim, to the point of subconsciously acting on that.

malefashionadvice,"Ahem, excuse me, folks.

I gotta say, we did a tremendous job with this road project. We really knocked it out of the park, believe me. It's the best road project in the state, maybe even in the whole country. When we started this project, people said we couldn't do it. They said it was too difficult, too expensive, too everything. But we didn't listen to them, folks. We went ahead and did it anyway, and we did it better than anyone else.

Let me tell you, we designed this road to be the most beautiful road you've ever seen. The lanes are perfectly spaced, the streetlights are gorgeous, and it's just a joy to drive on. People are gonna be coming from all over just to see this road, believe me, that's how great it is.

And we didn't just design a beautiful road, folks. We also made sure it was safe and efficient. We know how important it is to get from point A to point B without any problems, and we made sure this road would do just that. It's a road that people can feel good about driving on.

And let me tell you, we also did our part for the environment. We used sustainable materials, we implemented green infrastructure, and we even added bike lanes and pedestrian walkways. We're not just making America great again, we're making it green again too.

So I wanna thank my team, I wanna thank the great people of this state, and I wanna thank you, the judges, for recognizing our hard work and giving us this incredible award. We're gonna keep making America great again, one road at a time. Thank you very much, folks, and God bless America!",ahem excuse me folk i gotta say we did a tremendous job with this road project we really knocked it out of the park believe me it s the best road project in the state maybe even in the whole country when we started this project people said we couldn t do it they said it wa too difficult too expensive too everything but we didn t listen to them folk we went ahead and did it anyway and we did it better than anyone else let me tell you we designed this road to be the most beautiful road you ve ever seen the lane are perfectly spaced the streetlight are gorgeous and it s just a joy to drive on people are gonna be coming from all over just to see this road believe me that s how great it is and we didn t just design a beautiful road folk we also made sure it wa safe and efficient we know how important it is to get from point a to point b without any problem and we made sure this road would do just that it s a road that people can feel good about driving on and let me tell you we also did our part for the environment we used sustainable material we implemented green infrastructure and we even added bike lane and pedestrian walkway we re not just making america great again we re making it green again too so i wanna thank my team i wanna thank the great people of this state and i wanna thank you the judge for recognizing our hard work and giving u this incredible award we re gonna keep making america great again one road at a time thank you very much folk and god bless america,301,1

malefashionadvice,"I’m not sure about when the shift occurred, but it seems likely that they’re trying to save money on the company’s end (which i find lazy) by converting to a sole closer to the outlet version of the shoe. We, at my outlet store, sell a Wallabee equivalent with a fully rubber sole. A lot of customers have, in general, noticed a slow decline in quality over the years. We get a lot of older men who are upset about the Bostonians being discontinued within the next few years. I don’t know everything as I’m only a retail worker who has been trained and has experience in shoe maintenance and construction, so don’t quote me, but I do notice that the outlet shoes are less high-quality compared to the full-price store models which we get some of occasionally. These include shoes from the Unstructured line, the Bostonians usually, and a few other models. We recently got in a model from a full-price store that is for all terrain and is pretty much Clarks’ take on a hiking/sneaker shoe for women. It’s a higher quality build than some of our other sneaker style shoes. This case with the Wallabees is most likely the company cutting corners since they know how popular their iconic best sellers are. Our outlet equivalent has a fully rubber sole, if I forgot to mention it before. They probably think they can get away with changing the sole composition since they can sell the outlet version successfully. I don’t agree with the direction the company has gone in here, and I may ask my manager about quality changes since she’s been with the company for 7+ years. 
Also, I believe the best place to complain would be someone in customer service since they deal with complaints and questions all day long, so you can ask them if there is a way to get further information on what’s happening with the iconic Wallabee’s quality. 
TLDR; the build quality seems to be shifting in the direction of the outlet version of the shoe, and the company is cutting corners.

malefashionadvice,"I don't personally. To clarify, this isn't really a stance that I take with no background. I used to work in a specialty running store and am now a structural engineer, so I have a ton of experience in how things are manufactured and the lifecycle of shoes. Fresh foam showed a lot of promise in the Zante and Boracay days when it was first released (maybe 2014-2015 time-frame? It's been a while.)  


That being said, maybe I should say not so much that NB running is BAD as much as it's outdated, archaic, previous generation from what's going on now. Their super shoes (FuelCell Rebel) is using foam lattice that Nike had down literal years ago. In the running shoes industry, a single year behind is way behind.

malefashionadvice,"Is that a band collar shirt in fit 1? If so I'd wear it buttoned all the way up, it looks strange unbuttoned up top like that. You should also untuck the shirt and uncuff the pants (let them stack) and sleeves - the bunched fabric at the collar, waist, wrists, and ankles is overall giving a messy, stuffy vibe with brands whose MO is elegance and drape. I think if you make those changes fit 1 would be killer.  As for styling white pants, just think about building a nice color palette with the rest of your outfit (eg chacoal coat, heather gray sweatshirt, black shoes, or alternatively, pieces in different muted earth tones) and they'll look great. 

Fit 2 has similar problems arising from the shirt tuck, especially with the tapered sweats, it's making your hips look unnaturally bulging. It's also trying to force formality onto an outfit that will never look right being formal given the sweats. If you want to mix formality with sweats and a button-up shirt, you have to lean into making the shirt casual.

malefashionadvice,"Yeah I think it’s a valid thing to be concerned about. If you’re hanging out a bar in Bushwick and hoping to meet people, or you’re at business casual office in the suburban Midwest, those are very different situations. 

To be honest it’s a bit of a minefield, IMO. Black derbies are rising in popularity amongst the most fashionable people, but *unfashionable people never stopped wearing them.* They aren’t *that* different looking from the comfy thick-soled business shoes from companies like Rockport or Ecco or Johnston&amp;Murphy, which you will see *everywhere* if you go to an airport on a weekday (when it’s full of business travelers). Many of those business shoes will be black even with outfits where dark brown would be better. 

I’m actually not sure if that’s a good thing or a bad thing. On the one hand, maybe it’s a super power to be able to fit in with both the young hipsters and with your boss’s boss. On the other, maybe everyone else will think you’re lame. I just don’t know! 

Everything I said applies to all light colored pants worn with black shoes.

malefashionadvice,"Good evening everyone,

I am honored to be here tonight to accept this award for the best roadway project in our state. I can't express how much this means to me and my team, who worked tirelessly to bring this project to fruition.

When I first embarked on designing this road, I knew that it was going to be a challenge. Our budget was tight, but we were determined to create a roadway that was safe, efficient, and aesthetically pleasing. We wanted to create a road that would connect people to their destinations in a seamless and enjoyable way.

And that's exactly what we did. We created a road that is not just a means of transportation, but an experience in itself. We designed it with the user in mind, taking into account everything from the layout of the lanes to the placement of the streetlights. We wanted to create a road that people would enjoy driving on, that would make them feel safe and comfortable, and that would make their journey more enjoyable.

But our work didn't stop there. We also wanted to create a road that would have a positive impact on the environment. We used sustainable materials, implemented green infrastructure, and incorporated bike lanes and pedestrian walkways. We wanted to create a road that would be a model for future projects, one that would inspire others to think outside the box and design roads that are not just functional, but also environmentally conscious.

And now, to stand here tonight and receive this award is truly humbling. It's a testament to the hard work and dedication of my team, as well as to the vision and commitment of our community. We have shown that even with a limited budget, we can create roads that are innovative, sustainable, and impactful.

So thank you, once again, for this incredible honor. I am truly grateful to be a part of this project, and I look forward to continuing to create roads that inspire and connect people for years to come.",good evening everyone i am honored to be here tonight to accept this award for the best roadway project in our state i can t express how much this mean to me and my team who worked tirelessly to bring this project to fruition when i first embarked on designing this road i knew that it wa going to be a challenge our budget wa tight but we were determined to create a roadway that wa safe efficient and aesthetically pleasing we wanted to create a road that would connect people to their destination in a seamless and enjoyable way and that s exactly what we did we created a road that is not just a mean of transportation but an experience in itself we designed it with the user in mind taking into account everything from the layout of the lane to the placement of the streetlight we wanted to create a road that people would enjoy driving on that would make them feel safe and comfortable and that would make their journey more enjoyable but our work didn t stop there we also wanted to create a road that would have a positive impact on the environment we used sustainable material implemented green infrastructure and incorporated bike lane and pedestrian walkway we wanted to create a road that would be a model for future project one that would inspire others to think outside the box and design road that are not just functional but also environmentally conscious and now to stand here tonight and receive this award is truly humbling it s a testament to the hard work and dedication of my team a well a to the vision and commitment of our community we have shown that even with a limited budget we can create road that are innovative sustainable and impactful so thank you once again for this incredible honor i am truly grateful to be a part of this project and i look forward to continuing to create road that inspire and connect people for year to come,343,1

malefashionadvice,"The only way to tell is try stuff on. If you want that look (somewhat tight in the thighs, a little extra room in the calves) you need to find jeans that give you that same look. If your proportions are different from Elvis in his prime, you’ll need a different style of jean. Even if Elvis comes back from the dead and tells you exactly what these are, they may look totally different on you. Waist size, thigh size, and leg length (and how these things relate to one another) will all have an effect. 

Personally, I quite like the fit he has here. I would probably look for jeans that are called “straight,” “tapered straight,” “slim-straight,” “athletic,” or something like that.

Of course that is going to change a lot based on the brand. For example the straight fit might be just right on me, or it might be way too wide (especially at the bottom); the slim-straight might be just right, or it might be way too slim (especially in the thigh). The tapered or athletic is usually on the right track, but either one could be too tight or too loose in both the thigh and the ankle. 

And of course it depends on the person. If you have really big thighs compared to your waist, you might need something like a “relaxed tapered.” If you have very thin legs you might find that the slim-straight is too wide.",the only way to tell is try stuff on if you want that look somewhat tight in the thigh a little extra room in the calf you need to find jean that give you that same look if your proportion are different from elvis in his prime you ll need a different style of jean even if elvis come back from the dead and tell you exactly what these are they may look totally different on you waist size thigh size and leg length and how these thing relate to one another will all have an effect personally i quite like the fit he ha here i would probably look for jean that are called straight tapered straight slim straight athletic or something like that of course that is going to change a lot based on the brand for example the straight fit might be just right on me or it might be way too wide especially at the bottom the slim straight might be just right or it might be way too slim especially in the thigh the tapered or athletic is usually on the right track but either one could be too tight or too loose in both the thigh and the ankle and of course it depends on the person if you have really big thigh compared to your waist you might need something like a relaxed if you have very thin leg you might find that the slim straight is too wide,246,1

I tend to agree that derbies in general are too sharp for casual outfits and the black thin soled ones kind of fell in a bit of an awkward spot where they’re a bit too informal for a suit but too sharp for casual outfits so it made them a purely business casual shoe.

 And noted on the chinos, I think I get what you mean. The chinos kind of bridge the gap between the derbies and the casual sweaters instead of just looking like a place holder for black sneakers. Although I do think jeans can work if the top is a bit more formal like a button down. 

And yeah I was just looking for a good picture haha. Any recommendations on brands? I’m gonna probably buy a low priced version just to try it out but after a couple months if I like it I want to invest in a quality pair. My main thing is not getting too chunky with it, like the ones that look anything like below is too much in my opinion. Toe is too wide. I like a slight tapered look towards the toe.

malefashionadvice,"Everyone else is slating them but my experience with them has been infallible. Hockerty are unfailingly excellent and I've used them many times. It sounds like you ordered a 36R for your pants but vanity sizing means that these sizings are *very* different indeed from your actual measurements. It was including both your size and measurements but ordering 36R that caused you to receive the size you got. You should only order your actual measurements *not* your regular pant size.

As for customer service, they are essentially a factory in China with a web presence. They produce fantastic quality tailored clothing at a fraction of the price you'd pay at Neiman Marcus because they don't have the cost or resources to provide that level of customer service. If you want that, you need to pay more.

You should not dispute the charge with your credit card as this would be fraudulent on your part as Hockerty did exactly what you asked them to do and provided exactly what you asked them to provide. Frankly, your issues of timing regarding your friend's wedding are a result of your poor planning. They are certainly nothing to do with Hockerty, who got the suit to you in the size you ordered within the time frame specified.

Then you'd have to buy the same fabric from the same mill and bring it to a bespoke tailor to make you a vest from it. You'll need to do the same with the buttons. *And even if you do all that*, there might still be batch-to-batch variation of the dyeing / fiber characteristics of the same fabric from the same mill.

malefashionadvice,"What's the best way to use clothing to make you look more fit if you are naturally skinny?

One idea I've tried with two layers is wearing a thick sweatshirt/t-shirt as my base layer and a thin lightweight hoodie as my outer layer.

This is nice because the outer layer is tight-fitting and it fits on top of the thicker base layer, instead of your actual body if you were to wear the hoodie by itself. This makes you look less skinny and bigger than you actually are.

malefashionadvice,"Any of the regular advice givers here could've told you not to buy from Hockerty. They're cheap MTM suits and from what I can tell, they don't do a trial fitting like other online MTM companies (e.g., Kent Wang), which is really risky and unlikely to get a good fit first try. Good MTM suits cost ~$1k, clearly there's cost cutting somewhere.

&gt; I recently ordered a suit from Hockerty for my friend's wedding and ordered with plenty of time... I needed this for a wedding by March 10th

March 10th is next week? Sounds like you did not do this with plenty of time. For MTM suits you want to order at least 3-4 months before the event to allow for making the suit + shipping + tailoring + wiggle room for any delays (such as what happened here).

&gt; I used their sizing system... the slacks are maybe two sizes two small at least

You always have to size things based on measurements of garments that fit you well. Did you provide them actual garment measurements, and they got them wrong? Or did you take a big gamble on some weird online sizing tool, and it didn't work out? Guessing it was the latter?

&gt; I sent back the slacks today and come to find out the shipping label isn't even prepaid. I had to pay $25 to send it to them.

Buyer paying return shipping is standard practice, unless you provided clothing measurements to make and they got them wrong.

&gt; The customer service rep I've been communicating with doesn't even seems to have an appreciation for the situation or any empathy other than saying that they understand and are sorry

This company makes one of the cheapest suits you can buy, it's not surprising to me that their customer service isn't stellar. But what do you want from them? They said they understand and are sorry, do you want them to grovel? 

&gt; This has been the worst experience for a $400 suit

This is like saying Taco Bell is the worst experience for a $1 burrito. 

&gt; Since they don't do refunds because they say everything is custom made, I'm going to dispute the charge with my credit card and hopefully one way or another they don't get paid for the suit

This is a dick move. Ever heard the phrase ""Poor planning on your part does not necessitate an emergency on mine""? Let their CS fix the issue.

&gt; I could have gone to the men's wearhouse and got a good suit for $500.

No.

Those are also dark, like the gray ones you initially posted, and even closer in color to the brown - handsome pants but not a good combo with the jacket.

malefashionadvice,"The jacket fit generally seems good. At first glance I thought it was short via the [rule of thumb](https://putthison.com/the-rule-of-thumb-theres-a-rule-of-thumb/) but the hem is about halfway between the collar and the floor, which is correct - do you have long arms? if so, I think the rule of thumb doesn't apply to you.

In picture 3, the shoulders do seem possibly too padded for you. Can you feel any padding sticking out past the end of your shoulder?

malefashionadvice,"Hi I have been reading these and at this point I’m just picking a random one of yours to finally respond to.

LP is “boring” in the sense that the designs and overall attitude is geared towards timeless luxury and/or “silent wealth”. The original comment was a bit of a meme but also a bit of truth, and I have to say if you sell their suits you do a very poor job changing this representation.

The fabrics you linked are boring in that they are nice and definitely a bit fun relative to other designs, but it’s not just about that. The silhouettes LP goes for are not daring; there is nothing immediately fashion forward about LP in choice of design when compared to vendors like Peter Millar, David Donahue, Ted Baker. Those vendors all combine unique textiles with contemporary silhouettes—it’s not that LP *can’t* do this or won’t but rather that they just don’t because of their appeal to a more sophisticated and less trendy market.

But what this results in are rather boring cuts of nice fabrics which function ultimately as subtlety pieces for wealth expression rather than comfort or even textile composition at a certain point. If you dress people on suits you already know this. LP’s schpiel, which this article is correct to discuss, is in appealing to people like Larry David or Zuckerberg who will wear outlandishly expensive and lavish versions of basic goods without any branding or any kind of marker that it’s luxury.

Additionally, your overall attitude frankly just sucks.

There's an actual definition. Now, if something is being ridiculed or shamed, is it fair to say that people observing the ridiculing or shaming should not want to emulate the thing being ridiculed or shamed? Or put it another way, is something actually being shamed or ridiculed if it becomes a fucking style icon?

How much shame can the target of this alleged satire actually be under if people watching the ridiculing think ""this is sooooo cool, I want to be these guys!"" Seriously, stop taking the author's claim at face value, take a step back, and actually *think* about what words mean and how they are used. Consider a work not on its claims, but on its merits. 

Can something be said to be ridiculed if the ridiculing makes it more popular and appealing?

malefashionadvice,"This is such a personal opinion and Nuanced  question, because everyone’s preferences are so different. In all honesty, walking in stiffer shoes might be ideal for you if you have a need for stability or support. It’s like a bed, some people like soft beds some like them firm. I personably love a Nike Pegasus for walking/hiking. Saucony is great for more support and stiffness. On clouds are nice for responsiveness but I find they don’t last very long and wear out quickly, plus are pretty expensive for what they are. Hoka is a lot of vision but not a lot of support and a huge stack height so they’re unstable in my opinion. 

All of these have options in the supinate and pronation categories (neutral stride/supportive stride), so can’t recommend a specific one without knowing your case. Highly recommend just getting fit at a shoe store once and then buying them online. It’s also frustrating because many shoes change drastically between model years so even at best it can still be a struggle finding shoes you like year to year.

im a bigger guy(220pound) from Berlin, Germany and im looking for durable fashion in europe. A nice member from [r/BuyItForLife](https://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/) redirected me to you.

**What I need**: Jeans Socks Shoes

**Usecase**: everyday Clothing for Officetime(no Dresscode), going around the city and meeting friends/family

**Budget**: I work for almost minimum salary but im willing to spend a hundred Schmeckels when I can get quality that last for years.

Im  always just buying the cheapest stuff that seems to fit. But i hate  that its breaks down so fast. I want durable Stuff for a decent Budget  in europe maybe directly in germany.

I  dont care for Brands/Labels, because it was never a thing in our  family. The only time I buy something new is, when there is literally  not a single item in my closet with out a hole. That makes for maybe 2-3  items new per year. Everyone i meet says im dressed decently and there  is nothing wrong with my choice. But i never see something in the mall  or when out with friends and think ""thats nice i want to buy that"", it  just isnt in my mind.

Thanks to everyone for reading and for support. Sorry for my bad english.",hello everyone im a bigger guy 220pound from berlin germany and im looking for durable fashion in europe a nice member from redirected me to you what i need jean sock shoe usecase everyday clothing for officetime no dresscode going around the city and meeting friend family budget i work for almost minimum salary but im willing to spend a hundred schmeckels when i can get quality that last for year im always just buying the cheapest stuff that seems to fit but i hate that it break down so fast i want durable stuff for a decent budget in europe maybe directly in germany i dont care for brand label because it wa never a thing in our family the only time i buy something new is when there is literally not a single item in my closet with out a hole that make for maybe 2 3 item new per year everyone i meet say im dressed decently and there is nothing wrong with my choice but i never see something in the mall or when out with friend and think thats nice i want to buy that it just isnt in my mind thanks to everyone for reading and for support sorry for my bad english,209,1

malefashionadvice," Hi there,

New here, and I'm needing advice pairing a t-shirt with appropriate trousers.

I'm  looking at the below t-shirt, Doc Martens 1461 shoes on the bottom, but  I can't figure out what kind of trousers I should be wearing. The  picture shows some white jeans/chinos, though I'm thinking it may be a  bit garish for myself.

Does anyone have advice when pairing a darker top with appropriate trousers that also complement the shoes?

Should  I be looking at chinos, jeans, dress, something twill? Plain, checks,  another thing? Hope this is in the right place and thanks :)

And yeah no one is wearing truly wide ties (average ties are now what the Pitti types are mostly wearing) unless they’ve been wearing them since the 70s. 

Double breasted suits are classic, but they are uncommon. It’s extroverted to wear something that is uncommon, especially when it changes the whole silhouette. The same would apply to vests worn with a suit — classic but uncommon.

What do you think of tuxedos vs regular suits?

malefashionadvice,"Yeah, it's a good general guide that's helpful for most people. You'll run into issues if you have olive skin, because then the warm-cool dynamic goes off the rails - olive skin can look good in both gold and silver, but you'll find a lot of colours that should suit you make you look tired or ashy. And then some colours that shouldn't suit you, look great. Also if you're heavily pigmented or unpigmented - think people with albinism, or people who have very deep black skin - you'll find that most colours will suit you because most colours visually work on deep black or stark white, even if these are on humans of that tone. So it's hard to tell someone with deep black skin that they're a winter when they'll still look very fascinating in pastels, and brights, and warm neutrals.

But that's only some people.

malefashionadvice,"Bow ties (unless they are black bow ties worn with a tux) are often considered nerdy, but it is most definitely an extroverted nerdiness; your quiet unassuming nerds definitely aren’t wearing them. There is definitely some overlap between bow tie wearers and fedora wearers (though the bow tie is not nearly as bad). There are also often strong Tucker Carlson and/or Young Republican vibes. 

Neckties with a suit are too mainstream to have any particular association. Neckties with sweaters and cardigans can be cool, but old fashioned. Neckties with just a shirt are the height of corporate lameness, a uniform only worn by those who are required to wear it. The cool guys would rather wear a jacket with no tie than a tie with no jacket. Neckties with a short sleeve shirt are only for door-to-door missionaries. 

There is a whole list of things that tend to be associated with 1930s mobsters and/or Gordon Gecko: double-breasted suits, big lapels, big shoulder pads, pinstripes, contrasting shirt collars, French cuffs. Other than the French cuff, which is somewhat mainstream, wearing more than one item from that list would be quite extroverted.

malefashionadvice,"yeah NBs were part of it. ALD has had a relationship with New Balance for years thats produced at least 6 or so collab shoes. The founder is now the head of New Balances Made in the USA line. However, New Balance has always been sort of a prep brand since its Boston based and running shoes inspired.  And J Crew has carried New Balance and had its own collabs for over a decade (since the Todd Snyder Liquor store era). So that may be more of the fact that its always been apart of it.  Similarly, during that period the first wave of Gorpcore went viral, mostly riding on the back of the patagonia retro-x. Fleeces were just insanely popular that year.  I'd like to reinterate that it is not necessarily the items themselves (new balances, fleece, double knees) but the way they are combined that defined that era.  It's a more than the sum of the parts type situation.

Also, I have a chronic disease that often leads to stomach pain and/or bloating. When I’m dealing with that, (semi)slim stretch pants that stay up on their own are so much more comfortable than loose pants which require a belt or a properly fitted (read: slightly waist squeezing) waistband.

Prior to being acquired, Loro Piana was always expensive but still within reach of the upper middle class like senior management, lawyers, regular bankers and doctors. Their quality was top notch.  

LVMH has now moved pricing of regular fashion brands with crappy quality up to where pricing of Loro Piana used to be and this has caused all the major fashion houses like Gucci, Burberry and YSL to follow suit.  Meanwhile over the last 20 years there has been an erosion in tailoring, material quality and manufacturing origin (manufacturing in lower cost countries in Asia and Eastern Europe rather than Italy, France and UK.)    

Loro Piana meanwhile has moved pricing up to cater exclusively to the top 0.1%.    They also engage in monopolistic behavior like purchasing all the ultra-fine wool in the world (marketed as “Gift of Kings”) to prevent other brands from getting access to the material so they can continue to charge eye watering prices. 

Yeah, I have a wardrobe full of Loro Piana but these pieces were mostly acquired prior to the LVMH takeover.  I don’t bother with the mainstream luxury brands anymore.  Much better to find smaller classic brands that still maintain high quality.

Sorry, I'm going to have to vehemently disagree with you here. Succession is not, and never was, a ""satire"" of the ultra-wealthy. No more so than *Catch Me If You Can* and *Wolf of Wall Street* are satires of scammers, or *Breaking Bad* is a satire of criminal drug enterprises.

*Succession* is a full-throated pean to the awesomeness of being a billionaire. Yes, the kids are all morons, but they're morons who are cool and get pretty much everything they want. And Logan is constantly being held up as a man to be admired and emulated, even if he is a terrible person. The show puts it's characters on such a hilarious pedestal, even while they're doing the dumbest thing imaginable, and you're constantly being told ""look, the kids may be dumb, but Logan... now THERE is a real man's man.""

Silicon Valley is a satire of the ultra-rich. Arrested Development is a satire of the ultra-rich. Brewster's Millions and Trading Places are a satires of the ultra-rich. Succession is just a mediocre soap-opera comedy of the Tom and Jerry format with one rich old guy playing Jerry and his incompetent children playing Tom.

malefashionadvice,"It amuses me that Loro Piana gets so much hate in these posts. I've worked in luxury retail for many years and my respect for them has only gotten higher. This subreddit skews on the younger side and it will always gravitate towards the flashier, more streetwear, more celebrity driven brands (ie, LV, Dior, Gucci) when it comes to aspirational luxury. (Not everyone here, but a significant proportion.) No one really wants to be the ""boring"" guy wearing ""classic"" clothes.

Having worked with some of these big luxury brands and seeing the degradation of the quality that it used to deliver, it's amusing to see them focus instead on hype, print T-shirts/Sweaters and logo heavy streetwear as their bread and butter. (Nothing wrong with streetwear, I myself have plenty of it.) I don't blame them at all for that, it's where the money's at. Streetwear basics are easy to produce and is marked up like crazy.

malefashionadvice,"yes and also no. 

I use 2019 as the reference point because thats (plus or minus) when the big NYC prep revivalist brands really hit the mainstream.  It was the first ALD collection that hit mainstream appeal, it was the start of Blowing Razors (now extremely corny) collabs (particularly the barbour one) and NOAH's peak.  It was just when all the ""Is Prep Back??"" articles about those three and niche aesthetics really started gearing up.  I would say [FW2020](https://www.aimeleondore.com/pages/fall-winter-2020-the-worlds-borough) was the peak of ALD's Neo-Prep arc.  That 2-3 year period sort of solidified the aesthetic as a prep revival trend. It may have been bubbling under the surface but it really hit mainstream then and has kinda fallen back out since then.

As for Yes, rugbies, ocbds chinos, milsurp and sneakers have been apart of prep for years (if not decades).  However, the difference, as always in the details.  For example, a barbour, sweatshirt, ocbd, indigo jeans and white common projects was a big 2010s prep-heiritage revival look (and would have been very evident on MFA). These are not the items that define neo-prep.

When we're talking sneakers, it's not minimalist white sneakers, but decidedly hype sneakers: jordans, Air Maxes, New Balance 990s and collabs.  Its a product of the post stockx 2010s sneaker hype. The other major influence is how black kids in NYC repurposed polo and prep in the 90s.

Styling itself follows less of the 2010s heritage prep revival or the golden age of ivy style and is more along the lines of what one could find in an upper east side thrift store.  The focus is less on the rules of ivy and more on re-interpreting heritage styles and vintage aesthetics. Think about it like finding a vintage brooks brothers top coat, and a cable knit fishermans sweater that you pair with the carhartt double knees and jordan 4s.  Or how ALD styled it by pairing vintage denim with loafers (loafers had a big moment around that time) with a fleece and yankees cap or a tweed ball cap with a hoodie and some loose fitting corduroys with timberland lug soled boat shoes.",yes and also no i use 2019 a the reference point because thats plus or minus when the big nyc prep revivalist brand really hit the mainstream it wa the first ald collection that hit mainstream appeal it wa the start of blowing razor now extremely corny collabs particularly the barbour one and noah s peak it wa just when all the is prep back article about those three and niche aesthetic really started gearing up i would say wa the peak of ald s neo prep arc that 2 3 year period sort of solidified the aesthetic a a prep revival trend it may have been bubbling under the surface but it really hit mainstream then and ha kinda fallen back out since then a for yes rugby ocbds chino milsurp and sneaker have been apart of prep for year if not decade however the difference a always in the detail for example a barbour sweatshirt ocbd indigo jean and white common project wa a big 2010s prep heiritage revival look and would have been very evident on mfa these are not the item that define neo prep when we re talking sneaker it s not minimalist white sneaker but decidedly hype sneaker jordan air max new balance 990s and collabs it a product of the post stockx 2010s sneaker hype the other major influence is how black kid in nyc repurposed polo and prep in the 90 styling itself follows le of the 2010s heritage prep revival or the golden age of ivy style and is more along the line of what one could find in an upper east side thrift store the focus is le on the rule of ivy and more on re interpreting heritage style and vintage aesthetic think about it like finding a vintage brook brother top coat and a cable knit fisherman sweater that you pair with the carhartt double knee and jordan 4 or how ald styled it by pairing vintage denim with loafer loafer had a big moment around that time with a fleece and yankee cap or a tweed ball cap with a hoodie and some loose fitting corduroy with timberland lug soled boat shoe,365,1

malefashionadvice,"&gt; This is the take that bothers me the most.

I don't think it was really a take, it was just me idly wondering aloud. 
 
&gt; Firstly, not everyone dresses for attraction. I think thats important to understand. Upholding that pragmatism is the true dangerous thing, rather than the opposite: letting men in here know that there is an alternate goal in dressing. Expression can be internally motivated, not always external.

Yeah, for sure. I'm interested in clothes, which is why I'm here. I think the way you dress is awesome and you seem like a great guy. You obviously have fun with your style and that's really cool.

&gt; Also, people can form and maintain relationships independent of clothing. Wearing something that your wife doesn't find attractive or that your friends may think is odd will not ruin your relationship. 

Sure, but I do think it's important to continue to court your partner throughout your life, and part of that is trying to be attractive to them. It doesn't mean you build your whole style around them, but if I know my partner really likes my butt in a certain pair of pants, I'm going to wear those pants for her. Conversely, when she said my beaded necklace phase made me look ridiculous (it did), I found some other things I liked.

I also think I'm just not as into clothes as expression as some of the people here. I think clothes are fun, but the most happiness I get from them is when people compliment them. My best experiences with MFA have been when I see some new style or brand on here, try it out, and my wife goes, ""Daaaaamn!"" 

I think that's probably true for a lot of people who come here. They have other hobbies; they just want to know how to present themselves well. That's why they're on MFA and not Styleforum. And for those people, I think ""What do women prefer on men?"" is a relevant question (one I'm still idly wondering about).",this is the take that bother me the most i don t think it wa really a take it wa just me idly wondering aloud firstly not everyone dress for attraction i think thats important to understand upholding that pragmatism is the true dangerous thing rather than the opposite letting men in here know that there is an alternate goal in dressing expression can be internally motivated not always external yeah for sure i m interested in clothes which is why i m here i think the way you dress is awesome and you seem like a great guy you obviously have fun with your style and that s really cool also people can form and maintain relationship independent of clothing wearing something that your wife doesn t find attractive or that your friend may think is odd will not ruin your relationship sure but i do think it s important to continue to court your partner throughout your life and part of that is trying to be attractive to them it doesn t mean you build your whole style around them but if i know my partner really like my butt in a certain pair of pant i m going to wear those pant for her conversely when she said my beaded necklace phase made me look ridiculous it did i found some other thing i liked i also think i m just not a into clothes a expression a some of the people here i think clothes are fun but the most happiness i get from them is when people compliment them my best experience with mfa have been when i see some new style or brand on here try it out and my wife go daaaaamn i think that s probably true for a lot of people who come here they have other hobby they just want to know how to present themselves well that s why they re on mfa and not styleforum and for those people i think what do woman prefer on men is a relevant question one i m still idly wondering about,350,1

malefashionadvice,"&gt; This is the context thing I'm talking about. If you want to dress well according to what your peers at the office think, then talk to them or just look at what they are wearing and wear that!

I mean, yes, this is a big part of what I'm saying. I don't think context is emphasized on MFA nearly enough. Take the example that I just used, which you replied so vehemently about: if you are a millennial who works with millennials and dates millennials, then wide fits might not be the current trend in your social circle. That's context! 

&gt; These are also questions that a lot of other people have to wrestle with just to exist. How does a transman dress to present themselves as the man they want to be to the world? What about a gay man? What about a woman in menswear? These questions that you are assuming are nice platitudes are things that other people have to tackle inherently in other contexts.

You've made my point exactly. For the people you're describing, ""What will allow me to present myself the way I wish to be seen?"" is the relevant question. That's what interests me, and that's what many people come to MFA for, I think. If a transman is trying to figure out what they can wear to present as masculine, and you answer, ""Wear what will make you happy!"" it's worse than useless, it's condescending.

In my case, the stakes were much lower, but I thought it was interesting that a couple of women I talked to find wider fits unattractive. I think they're fun, but the people around me weren't viewing me the way I wanted them to, and that makes for a tough balance. I thought it was an interesting discussion, but... here we are.",this is the context thing i m talking about if you want to dress well according to what your peer at the office think then talk to them or just look at what they are wearing and wear that i mean yes this is a big part of what i m saying i don t think context is emphasized on mfa nearly enough take the example that i just used which you replied so vehemently about if you are a millennial who work with millennials and date millennials then wide fit might not be the current trend in your social circle that s context these are also question that a lot of other people have to wrestle with just to exist how doe a transman dress to present themselves a the man they want to be to the world what about a gay man what about a woman in menswear these question that you are assuming are nice platitude are thing that other people have to tackle inherently in other context you ve made my point exactly for the people you re describing what will allow me to present myself the way i wish to be seen is the relevant question that s what interest me and that s what many people come to mfa for i think if a transman is trying to figure out what they can wear to present a masculine and you answer wear what will make you happy it s worse than useless it s condescending in my case the stake were much lower but i thought it wa interesting that a couple of woman i talked to find wider fit unattractive i think they re fun but the people around me weren t viewing me the way i wanted them to and that make for a tough balance i thought it wa an interesting discussion here we are,314,1

malefashionadvice,"&gt; your appearance plays an important role in your social interactions

This is the context thing I'm talking about. If you want to dress well according to what your peers at the office think, then talk to them or just look at what they are wearing and wear that! Are company golf polos the big thing folks wear? Or are people wearing jeans and tee shirts?

&gt; Friend, you're in a subreddit called malefashionadvice. People come here because they want to improve the way they present themselves socially.

This first step for any task, especially ""self-improvement"", is to determine your goals. I _don't_ want to improve the way I present myself socially. I want to wear cool clothes that I enjoy and dress in a way that I think is cool. I think it's a useful reflection. What will make you happy? You mentioned above that you want to dress in a way where your wife thinks you're hot. That's a great answer! What's the best way to accomplish that goal _and make you happy?_ Is it a) go to an online fashion forum with a bunch of dudes on it who are not your wife or b) go shopping with your wife and ask her opinions on stuff as you try different styles/cuts/etc.?

It's not a nice platitude, it's required pre-work.

&gt;People come here because they want to improve the way they present themselves socially.

What does this mean? You're married so you're obviously not trying to impress more than one lady, but that's not the case with everyone. Are other folks trying to attract cis white millennial women, queer gen z folks? What contexts are you dressing in? Are you trying to improve social standing at the local dive or a concert you're going to, or at the office or in interviews? What does ""improve"" even mean? Actions to impress your boss probably won't play the same way with the boys down at the pub. Asking yourself ""what will make me happy?"" is essential!

These are also questions that a lot of other people have to wrestle with just to exist. How does a transman dress to present themselves as the man they want to be to the world? What about a gay man? What about [a woman in menswear?](https://www.reapersower.com/blog/what-is-it-like-being-a-woman-in-menswear) These questions that you are assuming are nice platitudes are things that other people have to tackle inherently in other contexts. 

&gt;Well, having a fancy computer won't make your partner swoon when you walk into a room, nor will a bad computer make them embarrassed to be seen with you. Your computer also won't affect the way your peers at work view you

None of this is true! Cars are _famously_ a social signifier alone! And what car you drive will mean different things to different groups of people, just like clothes! So you _need_ to self-reflect and figure out what your priorities are and what groups you do and do not care about. You might care about gaining social status with a group that doesn't even care about clothes all that much! And social interactions are all contextual.

malefashionadvice,"Cashmere pills.

This isn't a great use of cashmere, if we're being honest. Yes, it's super soft next to your skin which feels extra cuddly as a hoodie. But the structure of a hoodie doesn't lend itself to the actual fabric of cashmere. (Specific garments are made with specific fabrics for a reason, it's not just a whim of the style gods.) High quality cashmere also isn't typically used for hoodies for exactly this reason. Discerning customers aren't going to buy that, or if they are they're Elon Musk and can afford to replace their pilling cashmere hoodie every 6 months. So these types of garments are usually made with cheap low quality cashmere that pills even easier than the good stuff.

malefashionadvice,"&gt; It also makes me wonder whether a bunch of other malefashionadvice guys have wives thoroughly unimpressed with their baggy trousers.

This is the take that bothers me the most. 

Firstly, not everyone dresses for attraction. I think thats important to understand. Upholding that pragmatism is the true dangerous thing, rather than the opposite: letting men in here know that there is an alternate goal in dressing. Expression can be internally motivated, not always external. 

Also, people can form  and maintain relationships independent of clothing. Wearing something that your wife doesn't find attractive or that your friends may think is odd will not ruin your relationship. If it does, I'd think the relationship was formed on shaky ground that doesn't give room for personal expression. 

Personally I used to think that my mode of dress was a detriment but then i started to find people who not just didn't care, but *understood* clothes as an avenue for personal interest and expression. After that, i realized i didn't have to waste my time with people who don't get it.

And even if my partner doesn't like my pants, shoes, or hat one day doesn't mean she's going to break up with me on the spot. But also she understands i dress for myself and not for her.",it also make me wonder whether a bunch of other malefashionadvice guy have wife thoroughly unimpressed with their baggy trouser this is the take that bother me the most firstly not everyone dress for attraction i think thats important to understand upholding that pragmatism is the true dangerous thing rather than the opposite letting men in here know that there is an alternate goal in dressing expression can be internally motivated not always external also people can form and maintain relationship independent of clothing wearing something that your wife doesn t find attractive or that your friend may think is odd will not ruin your relationship if it doe i d think the relationship wa formed on shaky ground that doesn t give room for personal expression personally i used to think that my mode of dress wa a detriment but then i started to find people who not just didn t care but understood clothes a an avenue for personal interest and expression after that i realized i didn t have to waste my time with people who don t get it and even if my partner doesn t like my pant shoe or hat one day doesn t mean she s going to break up with me on the spot but also she understands i dress for myself and not for her,224,1

malefashionadvice,"I apologize for coming on strong, but this topic of discussion consistently blows my mind. Who cares what this random menswear blogger thinks if you like or are achieving your goals with what you wear? What does it matter what MFA is recommending if you care about dressing for your wife? If you don't _like_ the styles being recommended, then don't wear them! That's it! Dress in a way that makes you happy and random people on the internet can't tell you what that is! So MFA shouldn't try to optimize for dressing in a way that's ""flattering"" (whatever that means) and MFA shouldn't ""do a survey of folks attracted to men"" to optimize whatever metric that attempts to capture. MFA isn't doing a disservice to anyone because it's a free, user-content generated site. It would be a ""disservice"" if MFA was a for-profit blog that advertised dressing millennials in clothes in the slim-fit style of the 2010s and then recommended Levi's 501s. 

To steal a take from someone else: context will always be more important than trends. On the internet, context is removed, so it makes sense for MFA (a random internet forum about fashion) to talk about and focus on the current and prevailing trends. On the other side of the equation, I feel like no one else is putting in an iota of effort to figure out what their contexts are and what makes them happy.

malefashionadvice,"&gt; If you want to dress exclusively for your wife that's cool, but clothes are like the only hobby where people can't seem to understand that people will do it for their own enjoyment.

No, I totally understand that. In fact, I specifically called that out in my post -- ""flattering"" vs. ""interesting."" Personal enjoyment is a great reason to buy clothes. You seem to be arguing with somebody that's not in this conversation.

At the same time, your appearance plays an important role in your relationship. Having a fancy computer won't make your partner swoon when you walk into a room, nor will a bad computer make them embarrassed to be seen with you. Your computer also won't affect the way your peers at work view you. All of these factors are perfectly valid reasons to wear certain clothes.

malefashionadvice,"It’s up to you how much you want to spend. No one is going to think you look bad, if you show up in a cheap suit that fits okay, with a white shirt, a black tie, black socks, and black dress shoes. And I think it’s worth being clear that you don’t wear a suit to a wedding to look good, you do it to be respectful. You don’t even need black; charcoal, dark gray, and dark navy are still respectful and appropriate for the occasion, when paired with the right accessories. 

With that much time, you may find yourself in a stressful situation if you order online. You have to wait for delivery, hope that it fits well enough to be tailored, and then wait for it to be tailored (at a minimum, jacket length and pant length will almost certainly need to be adjusted). Buying in person will allow you to have a wearable suit much more quickly, especially if the store has a tailor. Men’s Wearhouse, Macy’s, Nordstrom, and local equivalents to MW are all good for that. J Crew and Charles Tyrwhitt are other chains that sell suits and (at least sometimes) have a tailor in house. 

Your disposable income matters as well. If you need to buy everything (suit, tie, shirt, shoes, socks) and $600 would represent several months worth of savings, don’t feel the need to spend more. If you put $2000 a month in savings and you like nice stuff, buying higher quality is a “might as well” situation.

malefashionadvice,"I wrote what I wrote in order to not end up writing a novel to some guy who just wants to know whether it's time to buy new pants or what. 

I'm happy to go into more detail.

When I gained weight in 2018, it was due to some major biological changes (big hormone fluctuations that are permanent) and also some big lifestyle changes (corporate office job vs. working in film production where I was getting in 15K+ steps per day just existing) that are also permanent. I suppose, if I had a time machine and/or had not chosen to make a big lifestyle change that year, I \*could\* weigh less right now. But that's not realistic, so my body is what it is at this point. I have found that learning to love who I am is much more healthy for me than developing an eating disorder in order to wear clothes with a different tag in them that nobody will ever see anyway. 

Could I undergo some kind of radical weight loss regimen via dieting and extreme exercise? I guess? This is something I've done a few times since 2018 with no dramatic effect. At best I can sustainably lose about 10 pounds, \*if\* I keep up the diet and exercise regimen. I like eating cake and seeing my child occasionally. They are more important to me than the achievement of clothes with a different tag in them that nobody will ever see anyway.

I am physically healthy, and my doctor is not concerned about my health or size. I am also fit enough to do most activities I want to do, buy straight sizes of clothes, sit in airplane seats, etc.

Calories in/calories out isn't a real thing, anyway. Like maybe if you weigh 400 lbs, have a severe bingeing disorder, and the solution to your health problems is to stop eating an entire bag of cheetos daily? But if you are a typical person with sensible eating habits, shaving off 200 calories isn't going to make a huge difference. The margin of error on food packaging, serving sizes, etc. is larger than most people cut via calorie restriction, anyway. This isn't to say nobody should watch what they eat, calorie restriction diets are 100% bad, etc. but in general the average person who is getting older, managing a busy life that doesn't have as much room for the gym as it used to, etc. is not going to dramatically change the size and shape of their body via a ""calories in, calories out"" approach. 

Nor should they feel pressure to. It is OK to take up space in this world. It is OK to exist, to eat a french fry every once in a while, to prioritize something that makes you happy over weight loss, and to buy bigger pants bc that's the size of pants you wear. 

Obviously if folks are medically unhealthy, need to get their eating, drinking, lifestyle etc. under control, and the like, yes, by all means go to the gym. Reduce the number of calories you eat (or whatever other diet). Striving to be healthier is amazing! Striving to make your body physically smaller for body image reasons or psychological reasons is not amazing!",i wrote what i wrote in order to not end up writing a novel to some guy who just want to know whether it s time to buy new pant or what i m happy to go into more detail when i gained weight in 2018 it wa due to some major biological change big hormone fluctuation that are permanent and also some big lifestyle change corporate office job v working in film production where i wa getting in 15k step per day just existing that are also permanent i suppose if i had a time machine and or had not chosen to make a big lifestyle change that year i could weigh le right now but that s not realistic so my body is what it is at this point i have found that learning to love who i am is much more healthy for me than developing an eating disorder in order to wear clothes with a different tag in them that nobody will ever see anyway could i undergo some kind of radical weight loss regimen via dieting and extreme exercise i guess this is something i ve done a few time since 2018 with no dramatic effect at best i can sustainably lose about 10 pound if i keep up the diet and exercise regimen i like eating cake and seeing my child occasionally they are more important to me than the achievement of clothes with a different tag in them that nobody will ever see anyway i am physically healthy and my doctor is not concerned about my health or size i am also fit enough to do most activity i want to do buy straight size of clothes sit in airplane seat etc calorie in calorie out isn t a real thing anyway like maybe if you weigh 400 lb have a severe bingeing disorder and the solution to your health problem is to stop eating an entire bag of cheetos daily but if you are a typical person with sensible eating habit shaving off 200 calorie isn t going to make a huge difference the margin of error on food packaging serving size etc is larger than most people cut via calorie restriction anyway this isn t to say nobody should watch what they eat calorie restriction diet are 100 bad etc but in general the average person who is getting older managing a busy life that doesn t have a much room for the gym a it used to etc is not going to dramatically change the size and shape of their body via a calorie in calorie out approach nor should they feel pressure to it is ok to take up space in this world it is ok to exist to eat a french fry every once in a while to prioritize something that make you happy over weight loss and to buy bigger pant bc that s the size of pant you wear obviously if folk are medically unhealthy need to get their eating drinking lifestyle etc under control and the like yes by all mean go to the gym reduce the number of calorie you eat or whatever other diet striving to be healthier is amazing striving to make your body physically smaller for body image reason or psychological reason is not amazing,554,1

It’s why I have a broader issue with the concept of telling people something is or isn’t “flattering”, it’s almost always a meaningless thought provoking cliche to stop people from enjoying clothing as a hobby with a writeup attached of all the persons flaws with their body.

If you're refering to bottoms only, I navigated in european indie / punk / emo scenes 20 years ago and people were ditching baggy everything for straight cuts with a low rise and a lack of taper.

The tops, though, were already slim by the early 00s. I was a bigger guy at the time and I had a hard time adjusting to the skinny shirt trend. I clearly kept on wearing XL 90s tshirts for quite sometime, because I did not feel confident enough to wear anything tighter. 

But I was happy when slim jeans were becoming more available at the end of the decade because straight fits of the late 90s and early 00s never fit me right, and that was either this or baggy / relaxed pants.

Welcome to MFA! You're in the right place to learn about how to dress. [This](https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/5da1xt/building_a_basic_wardrobe_v60/) and [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/5da1dc/the_basic_bastard_basic_wardrobe_and_inspiration/) and [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/11aw4xa/the_simple_someone_a_basic_bastard_inspired_album/) are great posts to read/look at if you're just starting out. 

&gt; My kinda shopping always will be like I go to a Store I just pick some solid Colours and come back. I feel this really hurts me and breaks my confidence because I think I'm too early for the formal dress code stuff

Don't worry too much about wearing just solid colors. Your confidence in your clothes will grow as you build your wardrobe and learn how to put outfits together, but it's a slow process.

&gt;I always think low of me i think so because of the dress code.

Is there a specific dress code you need to dress for? Or are you just looking for day-to-day casual clothing?

&gt; Kindly suggest some colours that are apt for dark skinned guy.

Skin tone doesn't matter a ton when it comes to choosing colors... some folks might say that some colors like jewel tones or yellow look better against dark skin, because they can make pale skin look washed out, but honestly it's not worth worrying about too much. The more important thing is that the colors of your clothes work together.

Feel free to post more questions in the Daily Questions thread as you're building your wardrobe - I'd also recommend checking out the ""best X for $X"" spreadsheet [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mhOIpjUUibBf3QueJs8iRJy5gBKCILq82ekJkiC5uqQ/edit#gid=0) (and the linked discussion threads) for item-specific needs.",hi let me introduce myself i have zero knowledge in fashion welcome to mfa you re in the right place to learn about how to dress and and are great post to read look at if you re just starting out my kinda shopping always will be like i go to a store i just pick some solid colour and come back i feel this really hurt me and break my confidence because i think i m too early for the formal dress code stuff don t worry too much about wearing just solid color your confidence in your clothes will grow a you build your wardrobe and learn how to put outfit together but it s a slow process i always think low of me i think so because of the dress code is there a specific dress code you need to dress for or are you just looking for day to day casual clothing kindly suggest some colour that are apt for dark skinned guy skin tone doesn t matter a ton when it come to choosing some folk might say that some color like jewel tone or yellow look better against dark skin because they can make pale skin look washed out but honestly it s not worth worrying about too much the more important thing is that the color of your clothes work together feel free to post more question in the daily question thread a you re building your wardrobe i d also recommend checking out the best x for x spreadsheet and the linked discussion thread for item specific need,266,1

malefashionadvice,"Hey ya'll, a few weeks ago I posted asking for advice going on my first ever first date, and I got a lot of helpful advice. My sad update last week was that I fell really hard for the girl, but she wanted to end things because she got a job interview in a different state that I ironically helped her apply for. Got a lot of sound moving on advice there too. 

Figured I'd close out my cringe arc with one final update, and ask for advice one last time from the fine folks of r/malefashionadvice 

So we were supposed to talk after her interview, but apparently she got sick and ghosted me. She texted me later that she got ignored by the company - they didn't call her for her scheduled interview, and that she still wanted to talk. I said sure, offered some times, and she never got back to me... So I guess I've been ghosted now, twice. 

And that's the end of it really. I spent the past week consuming my body weight in alcohol and cheese curds, trying to spend as much time as I could with my friends. But every time I see something I know was a mutual interest of ours, I immediately get the urge to text her about it, thinking we should do it together, *only to remember there is no we*. Every time I match with a different girl on a dating app, the conversation feels so... *bland and lifeless in comparison*. 

I guess my questions are: how do you not fall so hard for someone you click with, and how do I stop comparing all my future dates to her? 

Maybe this sounds ridiculous, given we were barely a thing anyway. From my pov as the classic ""lonely, socially-stunted younger dude trying to better himself with clothes that fit kinda well"", everything felt more vibrant when we were together, and now it all feels so black and white.

I first discovered this last Halloween when I used the holiday as an excuse to dress in a bold, alternative look (black ripped shorts, fishnets, combat boots, belt with draping chains, sheer black stretch top to show my black bra underneath, black moto jacket, dark lip &amp; eye makeup). Despite showing more skin than ever before, it felt so authentic to me that THAT made me feel confident!

My previous cold-weather clothing was mostly stuff I had gotten \~10 years ago, so I've been really happy with the update. II started looking at this sub + a couple of instagram and youtube channels to figure out what I liked, and made a pinterest to be able to put all the stuff I liked in one place where I could see it. Once I kind of figured out what kind of aesthetic I wanted to go for, I bought several solid, brightly-colored sweaters and a few pairs of pants in a couple of solid colors and a couple of patterns and in cuts that I hadn't tried before (wide leg, split hem, etc.). 

Now, random people started complimenting my outfits when I'm out, which has never happened to me before! And it does take much less time to pick an outfit and get ready, and I do feel more confident and feel like my personality is reflected a bit through my clothes.

femalefashionadvice,"Hello there! I'm a 28 year old female (29 in 7 months). My style has gone through a large evolution over the year: I was hyper-fem through early middle school (only wore skirts, dresses, or a pink sweat suit, never jeans or pants), then I evolved into dipping my toes into the alt scene in high school (very much baby, small town Alternative though-no colored hair or piercings, but definitely layered hair, lots of black Eyeliner, Converse, graphic tees, and skinny jeans), then in college I was very much the poster girl for 2012-2016 fashion, and now I'm kind of just a mix of everything I guess? 

My job doesn't have a dress code, dress code. Attire can range from nice casual to business professional, depending on the department. For my department, I'd say that range is more nice casual to business casual and this varies from day to day/if we have a special meeting or event. I've been slowly building my work wardrobe as I got my job after only working as a student and then we entered the pandemic so I didn't really buy ""professional"" or work-specific clothes for 2 years. Other than that, my purchases are leaning towards wardrobe staples with like 1-2 ""fun"" items per season as I've built up quite the closet over the years. 

I used to wear makeup everyday but my job got really hectic in Fall 2022 and I also was in a really bad mental state, so I just stopped doing it. Makeup does bring me immense joy and I love experimenting with different colors, especially with my eyeshadow. I also have quite the collection of makeup, so I'm on a low-buy right now. I'm trying to more focus on skincare as I'm approaching my 30s.  On the other side of that coin, I'm helpless when it comes to my hair. I recently bought some hot rollers to try those out since I have trouble working a curling iron (I always somehow manage to crimp the ends of my hair and the curls never stay anyway), but I haven't been brave enough to try them yet. I usually wash my hair, air dry it, and let it do its own thing aside from brushing it. 

Some final fun facts: I have very short nail beds which I jokingly call my ""child nails"" (my thumb nails are also very wide so press-ons don't really fit them); I have a pretty severe fragrance allergy (just short of anaphylaxis) so I have to be extremely careful of the products I use (Vanilla, cinnamon, and most fruit scents are usually ""safe"" while floral are an instant no-go); my mom always says I should've went into fashion design because I loved to design clothes growing up (I still love to sketch gowns here and there when the mood strikes). 

I stumbled upon this thread when looking for recommendations for the comfiest high heel brands (my go-to is usually Naturalizer) and saw it had some great advice on it. Excited to be part of the conversation!",hello there i m a 28 year old female 29 in 7 month my style ha gone through a large evolution over the year i wa hyper fem through early middle school only wore skirt dress or a pink sweat suit never jean or pant then i evolved into dipping my toe into the alt scene in high school very much baby small town alternative though no colored hair or piercings but definitely layered hair lot of black eyeliner converse graphic tee and skinny jean then in college i wa very much the poster girl for 2012 2016 fashion and now i m kind of just a mix of everything i guess my job doesn t have a dress code dress code attire can range from nice casual to business professional depending on the department for my department i d say that range is more nice casual to business casual and this varies from day to day if we have a special meeting or event i ve been slowly building my work wardrobe a i got my job after only working a a student and then we entered the pandemic so i didn t really buy professional or work specific clothes for 2 year other than that my purchase are leaning towards wardrobe staple with like 1 2 fun item per season a i ve built up quite the closet over the year i used to wear makeup everyday but my job got really hectic in fall 2022 and i also wa in a really bad mental state so i just stopped doing it makeup doe bring me immense joy and i love experimenting with different color especially with my eyeshadow i also have quite the collection of makeup so i m on a low buy right now i m trying to more focus on skincare a i m approaching my 30 on the other side of that coin i m helpless when it come to my hair i recently bought some hot roller to try those out since i have trouble working a curling iron i always somehow manage to crimp the end of my hair and the curl never stay anyway but i haven t been brave enough to try them yet i usually wash my hair air dry it and let it do it own thing aside from brushing it some final fun fact i have very short nail bed which i jokingly call my child nail my thumb nail are also very wide so press ons don t really fit them i have a pretty severe fragrance allergy just short of anaphylaxis so i have to be extremely careful of the product i use vanilla cinnamon and most fruit scent are usually safe while floral are an instant no go my mom always say i should ve went into fashion design because i loved to design clothes growing up i still love to sketch gown here and there when the mood strike i stumbled upon this thread when looking for recommendation for the comfiest high heel brand my go to is usually naturalizer and saw it had some great advice on it excited to be part of the conversation,533,0

Jeans which are technically mid rise may be more accurate of a high rise for you, or you may only need a shorter high rise option, it would depend a bit on measurements",so this high rise is definitely too much for your torso length i think but i also think that this fit perhaps is wrong for you in combo with that the diaper effect seems to be because the thigh and waist look too tight while the middle look too loose are these meant to be a straight leg or looser fit if so you probably just need to size up do you have a short torso jean which are technically mid rise may be more accurate of a high rise for you or you may only need a shorter high rise option it would depend a bit on measurement,109,0

A: I dislike shopping for swim for myself 
B: I don’t know places to recommend for a woman not in her 20s/30s.

She recently lost quite a bit of weight, but she dresses pretty conservatively so I don’t think she’d wear a bikini. 

Anyway, any recommendations? I’ve thought about Athleta and Albion Fit. Any similar brands you’d suggest?

femalefashionadvice,"Corset Story, from the perspective of a corset as an underpinning that supports and shapes the body, does not make a corset by that definition. They use plastic boning is the easiest thing to point to; many “bedroom play” corsets made by big lingerie houses will as well. Having never tried them I don’t feel right giving a full opinion but there are plenty experiences from other out there :) 

A quick “red flag” a corset is fashion/bedroom play is use of clothing sizes like S/M/L. A structural corset sizes by inches of reduction at the natural waist, from 16” up through 34” and higher. 

I’m wondering what you are meaning by “regular wear” in this case? It’s true a corset isn’t going to work with every style or fabric. 

Because corsets today can be fashion items worn as an outer garment, you’ll see the term “stealthing” to describe wearing a corset as an underpinning, most especially under causal baggy clothes. 

If you’d like to see how I look in mine and what I’m wearing them with, my Instagram handle is ACorsetedRarity. I’m wearing and overbust or underbust in every photo of me (that isn’t a swimsuit lol).

femalefashionadvice,"I’m in my late twenties and I’m still figuring things out. Being able to WFH full time really threw me for a loop honestly. I’ve been struggling because I LOVE romantic/cottagecore/princess core/preppy/dark academia AND minimalist looks (so I do not have ONE aesthetic), however since I WFH I don’t wear most of those clothes. I like for people to be able to see my outfits so since no one does, I primarily wear t-shirts and sweatpants. Which I don’t love. It’s not how I imagined my wardrobe when I was in college. 

Besides that, my industry gears more towards relaxed and casual outfits so my more dressy style has never fit in. 

I’ve gotten really into thrifting since 2018. I have donated a lot back too.

However, what I do know is that there are key pieces I will keep for years. Clothes and styles I keep tend to lean either minimalist or florals. I have clothes I still wear from 2007 because my weight hasn’t ever changed that drastically and the clothes still hold up. 

To me it helps when I put things away and then pull them out again later. Usually that’s how I know if I really will stick with something or not. Or if I have something that works for a lot of occasions. 

Lately I’ve been going more minimalist and in natural fibers as much as possible. I’ve also been trying unsuccessfully to buy less. I really liked the trends during the pandemic, they really felt like ME. So I’ve been buying more since I enjoy them more. I’ll probably keep them around for longer than other things I did in HS/college that I only bought because that’s what I had access too/what I could convince my mom to get me.",i m in my late twenty and i m still figuring thing out being able to wfh full time really threw me for a loop honestly i ve been struggling because i love romantic cottagecore princess core preppy dark academia and minimalist look so i do not have one aesthetic however since i wfh i don t wear most of those clothes i like for people to be able to see my outfit so since no one doe i primarily wear t shirt and sweatpants which i don t love it s not how i imagined my wardrobe when i wa in college besides that my industry gear more towards relaxed and casual outfit so my more dressy style ha never fit in i ve gotten really into thrifting since 2018 i have donated a lot back too however what i do know is that there are key piece i will keep for year clothes and style i keep tend to lean either minimalist or florals i have clothes i still wear from 2007 because my weight hasn t ever changed that drastically and the clothes still hold up to me it help when i put thing away and then pull them out again later usually that s how i know if i really will stick with something or not or if i have something that work for a lot of occasion lately i ve been going more minimalist and in natural fiber a much a possible i ve also been trying unsuccessfully to buy le i really liked the trend during the pandemic they really felt like me so i ve been buying more since i enjoy them more i ll probably keep them around for longer than other thing i did in h college that i only bought because that s what i had access too what i could convince my mom to get me,317,0

femalefashionadvice,"I've stuck with mine for years, though I'd say that it's slowly shifted a bit over time. I had a small closet first out of necessity for awhile - no space in tiny apartment rooms, didn't make much money, and moved/traveled enough that I didn't want to keep more that I could roll by myself in an airport. Now I keep it small because I like it that way!

I wear the same things again and again. I have some neutral pieces, but most of my closet are prints, patterns, and textures. I pick the ones I find most interesting, fun, and/or versatile and wear each piece constantly. Because there are so many options available now, everything looks similar, so I only buy items that stand out to me. I actually get bored sometimes when browsing because everything starts to look the same, and so I look forward to finding the few things that I like!

I actually find it easy to decide on outfits with a smaller wardrobe. I also like to challenge myself to mix and match what I already have in new ways. Sometimes I do realize that I haven't worn a piece in a long time, even if I did a few years ago - those I end up taking out, as I buy new things. I just consign or donate them.

I'm really into thrifting now, which makes the ""hunt for treasure"" even more the focus for me.

femalefashionadvice," NASTY Gal was great originally. When she 1st opened &amp; when it first blew up. But she either sold or got absorbed up by more mainstream retailer, I'm not sure which.

How I found this old thread. Now there are plenty of articles revealing that it never came back for season 2 because it was ""the worst netflix show in history"". I am shocked. I think it was the best show. I read statements like ""Sophia was unlikable"". WHAT?! She was not unlikable!! Why, because she had walls up &amp; was navigating a hard time? I loved her from the start. &amp; her journey. At time I could not wait to see what happened season 2. I was so upset when I learned season 2 would never come. I felt like the show &amp; the character grasped exactly what it felt like to be me at that time. I was nyc girl. But I felt like her Character could easily have been me. Or my friends.

femalefashionadvice,"I think practicalities like aging, having a more professional job, and moving to a different climate have influenced me more than anything, or rather they are the impetus to cause me to look at certain new trends and adopt them. But I have kept the same general style, which was designed for what is most flattering to my body type, and my body type hasnt changed.

For example, I’ve worn a very classic look since I was in my early 20s because it worked a lot better for my body style than what was popular then (low rise jeans! God bless you those who can wear these!). Fitted waists (midi skirts and high rise pants) and being covered up works for me. When I moved to a colder climate than I was used to, I turned towards one of the trends that was/is in - dark academia, because the turtlenecks and heavy blazers offered me a practical solution that (if tailored well) would still fit in with my existing style. When I’ve lived in hotter areas, it’s been more challenging as loose around the torso is best for the climate, but I’ve been able to gather a lot of linen in almost my usual silhouettes. 

So my changing circumstances has allowed me to keep adding to my wardrobe which keeps things fresh, but my aesthetic has been essentially the same since I became an adult, although trending slightly more formal and slightly less funky and vintage as I age. But I have always been interested in clothes (literally since elementary school - I loved Claudia in the Babysitters books for all you who know who that is) and found my style early.",i think practicality like aging having a more professional job and moving to a different climate have influenced me more than anything or rather they are the impetus to cause me to look at certain new trend and adopt them but i have kept the same general style which wa designed for what is most flattering to my body type and my body type hasnt changed for example i ve worn a very classic look since i wa in my early 20 because it worked a lot better for my body style than what wa popular then low rise jean god bless you those who can wear these fitted waist midi skirt and high rise pant and being covered up work for me when i moved to a colder climate than i wa used to i turned towards one of the trend that wa is in dark academia because the turtleneck and heavy blazer offered me a practical solution that if tailored well would still fit in with my existing style when i ve lived in hotter area it s been more challenging a loose around the torso is best for the climate but i ve been able to gather a lot of linen in almost my usual silhouette so my changing circumstance ha allowed me to keep adding to my wardrobe which keep thing fresh but my aesthetic ha been essentially the same since i became an adult although trending slightly more formal and slightly le funky and vintage a i age but i have always been interested in clothes literally since elementary school i loved claudia in the babysitter book for all you who know who that is and found my style early,285,0

femalefashionadvice,"My style slowly changes over the years but it's at a glacial enough pace that garments usually wear out before I decide to stop wearing them. Really it's more of a decision on when to stop repairing them and let them go that way.

Between the clothes I buy and the ones I make, I'm at roughly 15-20 pieces per year not including underwear and socks. I pretty much never declutter my wardrobe of anything still functional. I wear things until they die or I've changed sizes too much to wear them. I don't really run out of space for everyday clothes.

I absolutely wear the same thing many times. I'm currently procrastinating on repairing my favorite dress. It's been in my wardrobe for for near 6 years now and I need to alter the size and do a few repairs. I still think it looks good and I'm not bored. It's just not something that would really occur to me.

My style as a teenager was kinda bohemian influenced layers with prints and floaty fabrics. Moving into the college years, I had my goth phase (which honestly isn't completely over ever) and then I moved into a lot of Victorian influenced clothes in my mid to late twenties. Currently I'm in my early thirties and I'm wearing a mix of medieval influenced styles, Victoria-ish bits, goth-lite and the occasional practical everyday clothing. It mostly blends together into a weird but cohesive whole. I still mix in all my old clothes but they're remixed by matching them with new pieces. I've never been particularly into following fashion trends so nothing in my wardrobe is particularly in style or out of style. It's just it's own thing that I think looks good.

Some of the constants over the years since college have included:
-lots of flowy maxi skirts
-fitted bodices
-lots of black, scarlet, burgundy, plum, royal blue, sage, olive and ivory
-so many riding boots
-layered styles
-elaborate hats and headgear
-no jeans, no t-shirts
-embroidered details

Beyond those constants, my styles do change but they mostly still work together because they share some common ground. Keeping some constants while shifting the rest around keeps me both entertained and cohesive.",my style slowly change over the year but it s at a glacial enough pace that garment usually wear out before i decide to stop wearing them really it s more of a decision on when to stop repairing them and let them go that way between the clothes i buy and the one i make i m at roughly 15 20 piece per year not including underwear and sock i pretty much never declutter my wardrobe of anything still functional i wear thing until they die or i ve changed size too much to wear them i don t really run out of space for everyday clothes i absolutely wear the same thing many time i m currently procrastinating on repairing my favorite dress it s been in my wardrobe for for near 6 year now and i need to alter the size and do a few repair i still think it look good and i m not bored it s just not something that would really occur to me my style a a teenager wa kinda bohemian influenced layer with print and floaty fabric moving into the college year i had my goth phase which honestly isn t completely over ever and then i moved into a lot of victorian influenced clothes in my mid to late twenty currently i m in my early thirty and i m wearing a mix of medieval influenced style victoria ish bit goth lite and the occasional practical everyday clothing it mostly blend together into a weird but cohesive whole i still mix in all my old clothes but they re remixed by matching them with new piece i ve never been particularly into following fashion trend so nothing in my wardrobe is particularly in style or out of style it s just it s own thing that i think look good some of the constant over the year since college have included lot of flowy maxi skirt fitted bodice lot of black scarlet burgundy plum royal blue sage olive and ivory so many riding boot layered style elaborate hat and headgear no jean no t shirt embroidered detail beyond those constant my style do change but they mostly still work together because they share some common ground keeping some constant while shifting the rest around keep me both entertained and cohesive,390,0

I never have this problem with fitted leggings because the material is stretched and fitted across my whole leg. But with shorts the widest part is obviously my hips and that's where all the material on shorts tends to gravitate towards.

What I like as an alternate is fitted skorts, the tennis style ones. I still get the security of wearing shorts but with a flap of fabric either side so it still looks cute and doesn't show the shorts part riding up for the whole world to see

I found it at a J. Crew trunk show in like 2002. I remember trying it on over my clothes in the middle of a huge room, saying “good enough to gamble on,” because it was like $15. It was a dress from their suiting line, black wool crepe, sleeveless, v-neck, slight pencil cut with a slit in the back, just the quintessential black dress. 

That gamble paid off because— don’t ask me how, divine providence of some sort— it fit me perfectly for *years* even as my shape changed. Even when I weighed more than I do now. It came into my life at a point when I was just fumbling my way through early adulthood and needed the basics to work for me.

femalefashionadvice,"Blazers are me staple! They look less office-y and more petite friendly with the right accessories. These pins match the brass buttons well and the rubber bands help keep the sleeves up with the edges turned up to hide the rubber bands for a less lawyerly look. Exposing a bit of your arms helps reduce the stiff look and idk why helps with a petite frame.

Also I think petites can look a bit like kids playing dress up in blazers and jackets because the sleeves can be too long. Pulling them up solves that problem and looks cool.

For other blazers I add a colorful scarf. The formality of the situation dictates the material of the scarf. Work for me I’d pair it with a silk scarf (think power tie in menswear) and casual situations I’d pair a cotton one or one with more funky/edgy pattern. Or a chunky chain necklace or layered dainty ones.

femalefashionadvice,"Can we share “I love this kind of garment and here’s how I found I could to wear it”?

I love wide neck or off the shoulder or cutouts or strapless style tops and dresses but I’m plus size with big boobs and HATED strapless bras. I worked for a lingerie company and had literal tech designers fit me. Still hated them. 

I eventually started defining my fashion and found myself historybounding mid-century, which had brought back corsetry to some degree to women’s wardrobes. 

There is nothing as nice as having steel bones and your whole torso holding up your boobs. It’s real support! (I’m talking about an overbust corset here, which covers the bust and the torso)

I know it’s not for everyone and that’s okay but I wish more people knew it was an option and gave it a shot. I find the compression comforting (someone once described it as wearing a hug) and my clothes always fit well. 

Pro Tips: Steel bones not plastic. Not from Corset Story. Cut the straps off a tank top to use as a liner under your corset; you want to sweat into a washable garment not the corset. And probably watch a few YouTube videos like Lucy’s Corsets since it is a specialized garment and there’s a lot of myths and misinformation out there.",can we share i love this kind of garment and here s how i found i could to wear it i love wide neck or off the shoulder or cutout or strapless style top and dress but i m plus size with big boob and hated strapless bra i worked for a lingerie company and had literal tech designer fit me still hated them i eventually started defining my fashion and found myself historybounding mid century which had brought back corsetry to some degree to woman s wardrobe there is nothing a nice a having steel bone and your whole torso holding up your boob it s real support i m talking about an overbust corset here which cover the bust and the torso i know it s not for everyone and that s okay but i wish more people knew it wa an option and gave it a shot i find the compression comforting someone once described it a wearing a hug and my clothes always fit well pro tip steel bone not plastic not from corset story cut the strap off a tank top to use a a liner under your corset you want to sweat into a washable garment not the corset and probably watch a few youtube video like lucy s corset since it is a specialized garment and there s a lot of myth and misinformation out there,233,0

femalefashionadvice,"I’m gen z and I’m not gonna lie, the picture your comment conjured in my mind instantly read as “cool” to me!

i think that the effortlessness is the whole point. Looser clothing reads as relaxed and confident in a way that, in my opinion, skintight jeans and fragile blouses kind of can’t. The full loose top + loose bottoms look is definitely harder to pull off (and a lot of girls my age prefer the tighter top + loose bottoms look anyway) but even the fully loose look, when paired with some short layered necklaces, cool sneakers, and maybe some light makeup—really any kind of accessorizing that requires intention—is impossible to mistake as someone who’s “given up.” 

To me it seems that what a lot of gen Xers seem to be uncomfortable with in the modern trends is that the core pieces aren’t as resolutely and universally feminine, even though they can become very feminine when paired with the right accessories, and if that describes you I’d say that when in doubt, go with a dress!

femalefashionadvice,"No problem! It’s a little different buying leather boots if you’re not familiar with how they break in. Forgive me if you know this already. But generally, you want a pretty snug fit out of the box. It should feel like a firm handshake for your foot, is the best way I can think to describe it. But it shouldn’t be like, painful. Genuine leather stretches quite a bit, which is great once it does, because then it’s literally fit specifically to your feet and is super comfy. But out of the box they aren’t going to be ‘wearable’ comfortable and they’ll be pretty stiff. I recommend throwing them on for a couple hours at a time around the house until they loosen up a bit. Wearing thicker socks during the break-in phase can help speed things along. (This doesn’t apply to all of their shoes, as different styles use different material, and the presence of a heel might make a difference. I’m not familiar with those though.)

I’m usually a 9.5, and I sized down to a 9 for the 1460s. I wear sorta thicker socks that come above my ankle with these books, but with how much they’ve broken in, I can’t really wear anything else or they’re too loose. I’m planning on buying a pair of their Chelsea boots soon, and those I’m definitely going to size down to an 8 so I can wear thinner socks. 

Sadly, I feel like most of the negative reviews for Dr Martens shoes are because people don’t generally understand sizing/breaking them in. 

Also, sorry for the brain dump haha",no problem it s a little different buying leather boot if you re not familiar with how they break in forgive me if you know this already but generally you want a pretty snug fit out of the box it should feel like a firm handshake for your foot is the best way i can think to describe it but it shouldn t be like painful genuine leather stretch quite a bit which is great once it doe because then it s literally fit specifically to your foot and is super comfy but out of the box they aren t going to be wearable comfortable and they ll be pretty stiff i recommend throwing them on for a couple hour at a time around the house until they loosen up a bit wearing thicker sock during the break in phase can help speed thing along this doesn t apply to all of their shoe a different style use different material and the presence of a heel might make a difference i m not familiar with those i m usually a and i sized down to a 9 for the 1460s i wear sorta thicker sock that come above my ankle with these book but with how much they ve broken in i can t really wear anything else or they re too loose i m planning on buying a pair of their chelsea boot soon and those i m definitely going to size down to an 8 so i can wear thinner sock sadly i feel like most of the negative review for dr marten shoe are because people don t generally understand sizing breaking them in also sorry for the brain dump haha,284,0

That being said, I've almost kind of carved out two categories of clothes in my wardrobe:      
1, work clothes. I'm not terribly excited to dress for work so these are selected pretty much entirely based on function and office appropriateness. These don't go until they're unsightly due to staining/ wear-and-tear (or if they're not comfortable to wear in the office). The number is determined by the amount of laundry I can reasonably get to in a work week. The colour scheme is white, cream, black, blue and navy (unless it's a dress). The idea is if I wake up with 10 minutes to get ready, I can reach in there, grab whatever, and still look office-presentable. 
      
2, fun clothes. These do not always get worn to tatters - I let myself get bored of them. They're not strictly curated, because I usually have time to get dressed for casual things, so I don't need to pre-curate them for my half asleep late for work self.

its a traditional semi-formal (i think?) in a big tent outdoors at the end of april. its in new jersey so the weather in late april is so unpredictable there. could be 50° and raining, could be 80° hot and humid.

femalefashionadvice,"So there’s a few things with trench coats that are sort of the way they are because of the way they started. 

They were never intended as a solo thing, more like… a windbreaker/raincoat work with layering for warmth underneath. Historically, they popped up as a style pre-world war one, and when Burberry began using gabardine they took their waterproof windbreaker to the military, and were so helpful they became a staple in the trenches and thus became the trench coat. They were eventually marketed as being sold oversized to be worn over the “British Warm” which was a wool overcoat style of officers that became popular because of WWI. Though trenches were popular they were not provided or required, but were acceptable parts of the uniform which meant it needed some stuff other coats for the public didn’t. The reason for all the straps was for regalia and necessary gear to still be on the outside of your coat. Flaps and vents to air ya out so you’re not BO-ing up the place, huge pockets for more gear and flasks and maps. 

The styles were acceptable by military, but not required, and so they were privately sold to anyone, and often incorporated more leisure styles and patterns and prints to appeal to both function and fashion folks

Everyone kept their coats post WWI and so they *really* entered British popularity there. 

by WWII other countries invented their own for their military forces too, but the gist was still very similar. And over time the style just… really has not changed that much as it is so distinctive

femalefashionadvice,"I have a huge fragrance collection, amassed over many years. I like everything I own. But just like clothes, some fragrances are better suited for certain moods or occasions or seasons than others. So I think the first thing you need to know is that you don't need to have a 'signature' fragrance. This is just a marketing tool to encourage brand loyalty. You can like and wear as many fragrances as you like.

I think the first thing to do is to establish what fragrance notes you like and dislike. Go into a Sephora or similar and try lots of very different fragrances on paper to see whether you prefer citrus, floral, woody, green, etc fragrances. Wear a scarf and inhale into it when your nose feels tired. Do not sniff coffee beans in between tests, as is often recommended, as it overwhelms your sense of smell.

Once you have established which style of fragrance you prefer, you can try different brands within the same 'family'. You may need to spread this over several visits. A shortcut, if you don't mind spending, is to purchase sample sizes - Zara make high quality fragrances that are suitable for this purpose.

I wouldn't do the skin test until you're fairly confident you've found a fragrance you like. It is really only done to check that the fragrances combines well with your skin chemistry and lasts as long as you want.",i have a huge fragrance collection amassed over many year i like everything i own but just like clothes some fragrance are better suited for certain mood or occasion or season than others so i think the first thing you need to know is that you don t need to have a signature fragrance this is just a marketing tool to encourage brand loyalty you can like and wear a many fragrance a you like i think the first thing to do is to establish what fragrance note you like and dislike go into a sephora or similar and try lot of very different fragrance on paper to see whether you prefer citrus floral woody green etc fragrance wear a scarf and inhale into it when your nose feel tired do not sniff coffee bean in between test a is often recommended a it overwhelms your sense of smell once you have established which style of fragrance you prefer you can try different brand within the same family you may need to spread this over several visit a shortcut if you don t mind spending is to purchase sample size zara make high quality fragrance that are suitable for this purpose i wouldn t do the skin test until you re fairly confident you ve found a fragrance you like it is really only done to check that the fragrance combine well with your skin chemistry and last a long a you want,243,0

femalefashionadvice,"Okay, so while I don't have a clear aesthetic I have a somewhat consistent personal style.  My choices are somewhat eclectic but I've actually managed to shrink my wardrobe considerably the past few years while keeping a lot of variety.

Primarily, I'd think it helps to build a realistic view of how you use your closet.  While I don't have a capsule wardrobe, I've found that capsule wardrobe content is useful in that it allows you to see how much you can do with fairly little.  There's a focus on how you use things that can be a great way to approach organizing your closet to get a clear picture of what you have, and where you might have too much.  When I'm looking at similar items, I'll usually ask myself how often I'll want to wear it between washes.  For me, that's every 2 weeks, and I like to change things up, so for something like a black turtleneck, I wouldn't want more than 4 because I don't want to wear that more than twice a week.  I'm sure it'll look different for you, but the idea is to give yourself space to change things up so they don't get monotonous.  Try and have enough visual difference between similar things that while they serve might the same purpose, they're in some way distinctly different so while you're building the same outfit, it's not necessarily the same outfit.

As for what to keep/buy, I'd say work on building stricter requirements that aren't based entirely on visuals.  My current ones are things like color, fabric content, and versatility; even if I love something, if the color doesn't play well with others, it doesn't do much (i.e. shirts that can't stand alone and *have* to be layered,) or the care is fussy, I'm willing to let it go.  While I don't always do it, it also makes something like 1 in, 1 out easier.  Occasionally, I'll have a placeholder item, where I know what I want it to do but it does it poorly, and I'll make note of it so I don't end up with multiple items trying to do the same thing (right now, it's a fleece blazer that's patterned and the perfect weight, just too bright.)  Focusing on things mesh well instead of just being similar is great for longevity as well, because you can change up the styling or your go-to combos from year to year, depending on what's trending or how you feel.  Lists can also be helpful in being more conscious of what you buy: I keep a few, but the ones that have been most useful for moderation are the one that outlines my purchases for the year that I rate at it's end (the good, the bad, the unnecessary) as well as the one of things I shouldn't be buying because the section is 'full.'

Anyways, hope at least some of this was helpful and best of luck!",okay so while i don t have a clear aesthetic i have a somewhat consistent personal style my choice are somewhat eclectic but i ve actually managed to shrink my wardrobe considerably the past few year while keeping a lot of variety primarily i d think it help to build a realistic view of how you use your closet while i don t have a capsule wardrobe i ve found that capsule wardrobe content is useful in that it allows you to see how much you can do with fairly little there s a focus on how you use thing that can be a great way to approach organizing your closet to get a clear picture of what you have and where you might have too much when i m looking at similar item i ll usually ask myself how often i ll want to wear it between wash for me that s every 2 week and i like to change thing up so for something like a black turtleneck i wouldn t want more than 4 because i don t want to wear that more than twice a week i m sure it ll look different for you but the idea is to give yourself space to change thing up so they don t get monotonous try and have enough visual difference between similar thing that while they serve might the same purpose they re in some way distinctly different so while you re building the same outfit it s not necessarily the same outfit a for what to keep buy i d say work on building stricter requirement that aren t based entirely on visuals my current one are thing like color fabric content and versatility even if i love something if the color doesn t play well with others it doesn t do much shirt that can t stand alone and have to be layered or the care is fussy i m willing to let it go while i don t always do it it also make something like 1 in 1 out easier occasionally i ll have a placeholder item where i know what i want it to do but it doe it poorly and i ll make note of it so i don t end up with multiple item trying to do the same thing right now it s a fleece blazer that s patterned and the perfect weight just too focusing on thing mesh well instead of just being similar is great for longevity a well because you can change up the styling or your go to combo from year to year depending on what s trending or how you feel list can also be helpful in being more conscious of what you buy i keep a few but the one that have been most useful for moderation are the one that outline my purchase for the year that i rate at it s end the good the bad the unnecessary a well a the one of thing i shouldn t be buying because the section is anyways hope at least some of this wa helpful and best of luck,526,0

femalefashionadvice,"Based on your description it might be worth trying a different brand, but I’d probably test on a different area of your skin. I’ve never worn boob tape personally, but I use athletic tape a lot on one of my knees and some brands are absolutely horrible to remove from the skin (even after days of wear) because the adhesive is just too strong. It’s a fine balance between adhering to the skin for the needed duration vs needing to be able to safely remove from the skin… and I don’t really see any reason why the adhesive would need to be more aggressive for boob tape (I’d even wager that KT tape would do a decent job - I can usually remove it cleanly in less than a day if needed). 

The only other advice I have on removal is to go slow - and to hold the skin relatively taut by pulling on it in the opposite direction of how you’re removing the tape.

femalefashionadvice,"•Short dresses with long sleeves. There is no good weather for these where I live. I’m going to be either cold or sweaty. In the dead of winter, I don’t even like these with tights because inevitably I’ll wind up indoors somewhere with the heat cranked way up, and having no way to take off a layer or ventilate feels suffocating.

•Any closed toe shoe that isn’t a sneaker or boot. All no-show socks fall off my ankle and gather under my foot. I’ve tried many brands and assume this is due to my foot shape. If it’s cold out, I’ll want tights and boots anyway. 

•One sleeved anything. Just no. How can this feel good? 

•Most crop tops with sleeves. It’s not okay if it rides up over, or gathers around my boobs when I raise my arms. I asked my friends and their consensus solutions were dress tape and not raising their arms. My solution is not to wear stuff like this. 

•Cutout dresses or swimsuits = cold body or possible weird tan lines. Nope. 

•Low or lower mid rise pants. I was 19 years old in 2000 and that’s more or less all that was available and worn by anyone within 20 years of my age. I spent what’s typically considered the best-looking years of someone’s life with a complex about my body.

femalefashionadvice,"When I was 95 lbs (43kg), I had a pooch and still do now as I weigh more. So will most people at most weights. It's normal for bodies to hold onto fat at the stomach, so it's not about weight. Bodies just distribute fat in different ways.

I still wear tight dresses that end up showing my pooch - I like how I look in them anyway!

If you want to hide your pooch, you can wear more styles that draw attention away from it. Prints, patterns, and textures (all of which I use myself to avoid wearing bras lol).

When I was younger I thought midi and maxi dresses were frumpy, now I don’t like wearing mini skirts or dresses. I was more alternative as a teen/in my twenties. Now I have a lot more professional clothes, and basics. I always have some interesting/boho/eclectic pieces that I love sprinkled throughout my closet.

I have a hard time buying less, but I’m trying. I’m also trying to be more thoughtful about what I buy- is it filling a true gap in my closet? Is it good quality or will it fall apart within a few months? Does it fit/flatter or do I just like the idea of it?

I searched on YouTube and ground Innotree which also does cheap socks on Amazon. Their model from a few years ago which had 40-50% wool might have worked for me (3 pack for $20). But reading reviews the current model which has 60-80% wool might be more prone to losing shape. 

The search continues! I have found that the founders of Smartwool broke away from the brand about 15 years ago and started their own brand Point6 socks. Doesn’t seem much cheaper but there might be deals…

I think the founders left around the same time Smartwool was bought by Northface, and then finally bought by VF company, which also owns icebreakers.  

Cabot and Sons is the founders behind Darn Tough, but possibly a discontinued line. Some socks may be around still. The same mill also made JCrew and L.L. Bean socks before making Darn Tough socks, and the manufacturers said that J. Crew and L. L Bean went to Korea and one other Asian country I’ve forgotten. 

Actually I started reading some brochures from a Swedish yarn manufacturing company, which sources from New Zealand Merino Company, which also sources Smartwool, Icebreaker, and various other mid to high end brands, including Loro Piana. They have a 2016 pie chart that says China is actually the single biggest producer of merino wool now, and they have 21% of the market, compared to 1990 when they had 7%. Australia was the biggest producer in 1990 with 33% of the market then, and now has 19%. China certainly had massive growth in wool. Could explain why brands are moving off seas… 

Anyway it seems like one of the ways sock companies try to distinguish from each other is by the seamless quality of their toe seam. Socks are knit as a tube with an open gap at the toe, which has to be closed with a seam. Sock manufacturers highlight their ability to do a flat, seamless, almost invisible seam there, which is relatively new tech I guess (last ten or twenty years). 

Also the reason why Darn Tough socks are so dense is that they are made three times their final size, then shrunk down. 

And Darn Tough also does factory sales in Vermont where their manufacturing plant is. While Smartwool does sales at their plant In Tennessee.",thank you for telling me about lower wool content sock i think i will try out those kind of sock it could be a good compromise otherwise i might just go for synthetic for light and durable sock i did check out danish endurance on amazon but it seems like most of the sock i saw had acrylic in them which i think of a more a winter material i searched on youtube and ground innotree which also doe cheap sock on amazon their model from a few year ago which had 40 50 wool might have worked for me 3 pack for 20 but reading review the current model which ha 60 80 wool might be more prone to losing shape the search continues i have found that the founder of smartwool broke away from the brand about 15 year ago and started their own brand point6 sock doesn t seem much cheaper but there might be deal i think the founder left around the same time smartwool wa bought by northface and then finally bought by vf company which also owns icebreaker cabot and son is the founder behind darn tough but possibly a discontinued line some sock may be around still the same mill also made jcrew and bean sock before making darn tough sock and the manufacturer said that j crew and l l bean went to korea and one other asian country i ve forgotten actually i started reading some brochure from a swedish yarn manufacturing company which source from new zealand merino company which also source smartwool icebreaker and various other mid to high end brand including loro piana they have a 2016 pie chart that say china is actually the single biggest producer of merino wool now and they have 21 of the market compared to 1990 when they had 7 australia wa the biggest producer in 1990 with 33 of the market then and now ha 19 china certainly had massive growth in wool could explain why brand are moving off sea anyway it seems like one of the way sock company try to distinguish from each other is by the seamless quality of their toe seam sock are knit a a tube with an open gap at the toe which ha to be closed with a seam sock manufacturer highlight their ability to do a flat seamless almost invisible seam there which is relatively new tech i guess last ten or twenty year also the reason why darn tough sock are so dense is that they are made three time their final size then shrunk down and darn tough also doe factory sale in vermont where their manufacturing plant is while smartwool doe sale at their plant in tennessee,458,0

femalefashionadvice,"Look, weight, BMI, stomach, pooch, etc, has absolutely nothing, let me emphasize this, *nothing*, to do with whether or not you can have a good style or fashion sense or wear clothing. I get why you seem to feel this way, it is how a lot of diet culture stuff gets shoved in, but the way your comment is worded is really kinda… phobic sounding. That doesn’t really fly here, since this sub is very body acceptance heavy and we help people here of all shapes and sizes. Because everyone should be able to feel good in their body and in their clothes. This is why you got a couple downvoted and gotten what seems to be a now mod-deleted not super nice comment. 

That being said, on to your question. 

So essentially, if you are looking to *hide* this feature, you’re going to need your shape info for us to provide flattering recommendations. This will be more based on your ratio between measurements and your proportions. For example, I have a slim waist compared to my larger hip and bust measurements, making me more of an hourglass shape. How clothes work for us (because clothes are meant to work for our bodies, not our bodies for clothes) and what clothes seem traditionally flattering will change based on this shape. 

Knowing what type of skirts/dresses you went for will also be helpful in helping you understand what about their shape/fit/fabric isn’t helpful, since this too, can vary and despite what you may think initially, is not so simple as just “tight = visible pooch”

I can help and would be happy to provide some recommendations based on these and what kind of aesthetic/style you’re interested in, it’s one of my fave things to help people with here. 

More generally speaking: if hiding your stomach is a priority, you may want to try

1. More structured fabrics. This I know seems counterintuitive, as these offer less stretch, but… Things like tweed and denim hold shape and structure more than stretchier fabrics, meaning that they provide and define a form where perhaps you feel you have less in a way you find flattering.

2. a line or flared skirts/dresses these in a structured fabric also flare outward from your stomach slightly, providing visual interest and volume in another location, which draws the eye away from this point you’d prefer to hide

3. Wrap skirts are super flexible on sizing and are super flowy, allowing again more visual interest elsewhere 

I can provide more detailed reccs based on your measurements specifically, since beyond this there’s quite a bit of variety. 

You and I are around the same height and weight, I’m a bit shorter as I fall in the petite category, and a smidge heavier (I’m freaking like half boob over here lmao), a belly pooch is a perfectly normal thing at *any* size because as your doc said, our uteruses take up space. When I was your age a couple years back I was lighter than you and still had it cause it’s NORMAL. Not to mention bloating and a full stomach and eating all cause a pooch throughout the day anyways even if you rip your uterus and all that out, because food has to go somewhere when you eat it during your day. I post plenty in WAYWT, and though I don’t hide my pooch purposely, most of my outfits simply create visual interest elsewhere which means it just doesn’t draw other people’s eye to that spot. Often commenters are surprised by my weight, height, and proportions because you can dress just as awesome around it. Your stomach’s existence, I promise you, is not something that will ruin your sense of style or your outfits. There are ways to hide it, there are ways to draw the eye elsewhere so it’s not noticeable, both of these are great, but please do not ever feel either is necessary, especially not in this subreddit.",look weight bmi stomach pooch etc ha absolutely nothing let me emphasize this nothing to do with whether or not you can have a good style or fashion sense or wear clothing i get why you seem to feel this way it is how a lot of diet culture stuff get shoved in but the way your comment is worded is really kinda phobic sounding that doesn t really fly here since this sub is very body acceptance heavy and we help people here of all shape and size because everyone should be able to feel good in their body and in their clothes this is why you got a couple downvoted and gotten what seems to be a now mod deleted not super nice comment that being said on to your question so essentially if you are looking to hide this feature you re going to need your shape info for u to provide flattering recommendation this will be more based on your ratio between measurement and your proportion for example i have a slim waist compared to my larger hip and bust measurement making me more of an hourglass shape how clothes work for u because clothes are meant to work for our body not our body for clothes and what clothes seem traditionally flattering will change based on this shape knowing what type of skirt dress you went for will also be helpful in helping you understand what about their shape fit fabric isn t helpful since this too can vary and despite what you may think initially is not so simple a just tight visible pooch i can help and would be happy to provide some recommendation based on these and what kind of aesthetic style you re interested in it s one of my fave thing to help people with here more generally speaking if hiding your stomach is a priority you may want to try 1 more structured fabric this i know seems counterintuitive a these offer le stretch but thing like tweed and denim hold shape and structure more than stretchier fabric meaning that they provide and define a form where perhaps you feel you have le in a way you find flattering 2 a line or flared skirt dress these in a structured fabric also flare outward from your stomach slightly providing visual interest and volume in another location which draw the eye away from this point you d prefer to hide 3 wrap skirt are super flexible on sizing and are super flowy allowing again more visual interest elsewhere i can provide more detailed reccs based on your measurement specifically since beyond this there s quite a bit of variety you and i are around the same height and weight i m a bit shorter a i fall in the petite category and a smidge heavier i m freaking like half boob over here lmao a belly pooch is a perfectly normal thing at any size because a your doc said our uterus take up space when i wa your age a couple year back i wa lighter than you and still had it cause it s normal not to mention bloating and a full stomach and eating all cause a pooch throughout the day anyways even if you rip your uterus and all that out because food ha to go somewhere when you eat it during your day i post plenty in waywt and though i don t hide my pooch purposely most of my outfit simply create visual interest elsewhere which mean it just doesn t draw other people s eye to that spot often commenters are surprised by my weight height and proportion because you can dress just a awesome around it your stomach s existence i promise you is not something that will ruin your sense of style or your outfit there are way to hide it there are way to draw the eye elsewhere so it s not noticeable both of these are great but please do not ever feel either is necessary especially not in this subreddit,682,0

femalefashionadvice,"Omg I adore them, their sizing if you’re mid sized/hourglass shaped for bottoms tbh sucks, but I have the midi cocktail skirt despite this, and have rented a few tops and dresses and always love those

Other lil shops I like:

Aym studio for shapewear-esque dresses, love love love, size inclusive, small woman owned business and and so flattering. The only body con dresses I wear

Tuesday of California is a cute small business for kitschy fun stuff. Used to have a collared dress with daggers on each collar from them? Wore the thing to death 

If I ever go down the expensive mini bag route for some reason I already know Jacquelement is who is getting my money. 

Shop Kikay is a queer owned business I’ve been into for years, and invented these clothes rack hangers for earrings? I have two of them filled with stuff I’ve bought from them over the years. My ears could be miss frizzle if I tried

Calamityware if you ever need fun dishes and serving ware, looks like traditional blue china but… robots and dinosaurs and the loch ness monster. First thing I put on our wedding registry when we made it lmao

Studio Cult Co for funky bags and funky jewelry. Do I *need* a bread tag shaped purse? No. Do I have it bookmarked just in case I ever do? Sure

Frankly Apparel, Klassy Network, and Buzzoms are all in my saves to check out over time for braless yet big boob friendly options

Wolf and Badger is an awesome spot to find a huge range of items at various price points. From well known to smaller designers. Always know I’m going to be the only one at an event rolling up in small brands I find there

House of Sunny I have a few items from and actually am pretty pleased with! I’ve got a knit dress and bright green knit pair of flare pants, as well as a biker vest, two of those are super frequent wears for me. 

Selkie is made out of demon spawn hair or something, it’s itchy as hell, instead Maison Amory is similar in aesthetic and a sister brand that I’ve yet to try but hear way better things about the construction of

Leze the Label though is a workhorse for the fall/winter for me. Freaking work looking pants that are cozy like sweatpants? And they’re ungodly amounts of stretchy? So comfy. I’ve got three pairs of pants from them from when I was doing on call work and needed to be up and dressed well and out of the house in the middle of the night in 10 minutes

femalefashionadvice,"Wearing workout clothing to run errands at the grocery store and various coffee shops is totally the thing to do.  Not just any athleisure wear - very nice athleisure wear.  People notice - down to the handbag one carries with their athleisure wear.  The Buckhead crowd is usually thinner than the norm, especially older ladies.  Wearing black leggings, a zip jacket in a bright color, gray sneakers, big sunglasses, heavy 14kt gold jewelry, and perfectly done hair and nails finish the look.  The puffy vest is very popular here, too - except when you need to wear your short camel coat or short white jacket with sleeves.  Logos are considered tasteless and monograms are the rule.  Men wear the standard khaki pants, blue button down polo shirt, alligator belt, leather loafers without socks and tortoise shell frames on glasses/sunglasses.  Everyone buys their own personal grocery sacks from Whole  Foods - they never carry the brown paper sack out of the grocery store.  Nails are big in Atlanta - shorter nails for the caucasian community done in shades of white/cream, red or cajun shrimp color.  No one complains about the hot weather in Atlanta.

femalefashionadvice,"I’m fucking dead her ponte pants comments are absolutely hilarious. Idk what they did to her but I’m glad they did cause I got a good laugh out of it 

I’m also not a huge fan of them tbh, largely because they’re often just kinda black and tapered and lack their own structure and that combo on me looks like a wee color-scheme-confused hobbit 

But yeah I think that there’s a lot of misconception about other people’s intentions in the initial post. My friend dresses for frugality, appropriateness, and her own comfort in that order of priority. Her intention in any outfit is never to say she looks trendy or not, (though sometimes she is or isn’t) nor is it to say she is fashionable or not (though sometimes it is or isn’t). While it probably, yes, does show to people who keep track of those things that it is not a priority for her, but isn’t a reflection of a lack of awareness of the passage of time (though that also is a great line). She *just this month* bought straight leg jeans for the first time. 

While certainly clothing and how you dress can and does say something to others, and we can make guesses about others’ intentions from their own clothing, both ways it’s just guesswork. If someone wore white to a wedding I’ve got a good inkling their intention is to be noticed and not caring if it’s in a bad way, but hey, for all I know about that person and their context getting dressed that day (which is nothing beyond being at the same event) that’s the bride’s aunt Susan wearing the bride’s deceased mom’s dress at the bride’s request. The point is: there’s a hundred reasons other than “I look fashionable” to put on different articles in the morning and no assumption or guesswork on the logic is going to be guaranteed. Especially when, for many people, the fashionable-ness or trendy-ness is farther from their mind than it is for many people here.

femalefashionadvice,"Your second paragraph was about how older women shouldn’t care what 20-year olds think. My point was that older women are typically not dressing to impress 20-year olds. Even those that truly are dressing to look younger are likely not dressing for the 20-year olds.

Also responding to this 

&gt;	But encouraging women to switch to trendy clothes regardless of their own personal opinion is pressuring them to be young. And the effort is fruitless - by the time older women successfully catch up to the trend, it’s already changed.

I don’t see how you got this from OPs post. Women who are struggling to let go of skinny jeans are likely not the types that try to keep up with micro trends for 20-year olds on social media. Most people just want to look somewhat current to be perceived a certain way by their peers, partners and coworkers. If they had a strong sense of style and felt comfortable in their skinny jeans and booties they would not be visiting this forum at all. For women who come to a fashion advice forum for advice, telling them to listen to their own opinion is not helpful. Providing some simple suggestions to get out of a rut is not at all the same as pressuring women to look young and is also very different from pressures to do Botox and procedures in society at large.

So since you’re taller I’ll use asos since most of their brands are super kind to your height. Typically with grad dresses you want to be certain the hem of the dress is not longer than your gown, and that the color isn’t super obnoxiously visible through the gown (which for black isn’t an issue!). I’ll be checking the height of models to make sure that these won’t be too long that they’ll be below your gown too!

[this is a nice but casual-er leaning option](https://www.asos.com/us/prd/202858515?acquisitionsource=pasteboard). With broader shoulders the vneck will draw the eye away from that feature, plus cute little embroidered flowers, a looser fit to sit in is also super nice since depending on location sometimes it can be super uncomfy for all that time.

[this jacquard option](https://www.asos.com/us/prd/203816224?acquisitionsource=pasteboard) is square neck and a print which both will bring the eye a bit elsewhere, again not a tight fit, and formal without being overly so, but a bit dressier than the prior option, and a bit more colorful without being *bright* and will be pretty unique 

[this black floral wrap dress](https://www.asos.com/us/prd/203185082?acquisitionsource=pasteboard) will be a common style, but again, v neck to draw that eye down and a looser fit will be great for you, but the dark base color with a lighter larger print floral will make it a bit more standout as different 

I know you said you’re thinking midi, but let me hit you with a few shorter styles too, since you said you really dig your long legs

[this might not be a grad vibe but seems up your alley tbh](https://www.asos.com/us/prd/201204401?acquisitionsource=pasteboard) just for the color alone, but that neckline and the flare sleeves will give you that eye elsewhere, highlight your long legs without being too short (since the model is your height)

[this floral flowy mini](https://www.asos.com/us/prd/202695878?acquisitionsource=pasteboard) could work well for both! 

This [large pattern floral](https://www.asos.com/us/prd/203344115?acquisitionsource=pasteboard) would also be a good candidate, add structure to your shoulders that isn’t yours, with a print and neckline making you look elsewhere, in a darker color way with light sections that is pretty multi seasonal.

femalefashionadvice,"I think you really need to reread my comment and hold back on the initial upset reaction you had.  

Literally nowhere did I say that older women are dressing to impress younger people or are supposed to be frumpy. It’s a statement about how marking clothes associated with older women as ugly/dated/unfashionable is ageist. If you cannot see at all how the fashion industry or beauty industry fuels a lot of ageist marketing towards women, I encourage you to crack open the huge wealth of sociological research aimed at that exact subject. I have a degree in it now; I would know. 

The fashion industry is obviously not driven by 18 year olds. That’s a ridiculous statement and is a very surface level interpretation of what I said. It is very plainly obvious that many designers are older people. However, if you seriously do not think that younger women are the “ideal” type market for trendier clothing, pick any major clothing manufacturer and look at who the models are in their sample photos. Look at the ages of the models they send down the runway. They’re nearly all younger women.

And now we’re turning around and saying we’re “too short” or “too fat” for the shapes we once found so flattering that we were reluctant to drop them?? 

Like, I was not an early adopter of the skinnies + volume on top thing because I thought I was too short for the pants and too busty for the tops. In retrospect, that was simply fueled by adolescent body angst. The lesson I took from that experience was not to fear change because my body is what it is, and it will look like what it is no matter what I wear. I won’t look 8 inches taller and 10 lbs lighter by wearing wide legs instead of skinnies or vice versa. And that’s OK!

femalefashionadvice,"Gotcha, for some reason I mistakenly assumed it was your first time! For family fun, I think your sneakers will be just fine. I haven't been out to Vegas since the pandy and family moving out of that area, but there's such a variety of fashion from very casual to very glam that I don't think you'll stand out in a bad way. You can check out Pinterest for inspiration on fashionable sneaker outfits. You could probably even wear them with your maxi, with or without one of your zip hoodies for a ""pretty"" casual look. Maxi, cardi and sandals would be a step up in formality from that. If I were you, I'd use it as an excuse to go shopping, particularly for up-to-date accessories.

femalefashionadvice,"Yeah I’d stick with a skirt about them and omg yeah ruching can be SO particular. I find the only brand that consistently does ruched items that work well for hourglass figures is Club Monaco, and they usually only have one a season, if that, but the two I have are *excellent* and are staples for me for date night stuff.

I should’ve clarified, shy away from a line dresses unless it is just the skirt that is a line from the waist down, cause yeah, wonky measurements. But A line and drapey skirts work SUPER well, ya buy for your waist and to get them over your hips and as long as you’ve got those down pat you are golden. 

For short skirts things I recently discovered [these](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09G6K6ZGR?ref=ppx_pop_mob_ap_share) which I decided to give a try for cheap in order to see if I could make the style work (plus a SKORT? Yes please) and omg they’re stretchy and cute and absolutely marvelous.

femalefashionadvice,"Hello hello twin lil friend

I am also on the edge of petite height wise, and mid sized because of my hourglass shape causing some bonkers proportions but much of the advice not working for me because I carry very little in my waist/stomach

So I find defining the waist to be key to making skirts and dresses work. A line and drapey things with *vertical* interest are awesome, but I’ve lately been drawn to short skirts that fit at the waist, stop at or above mid thigh, paired with tights and coordinating pointed toe shoes to elongate the leg away from looking hobbity (I often feel hobbitty, which though I love their aesthetic it just isn’t my vibe when everyone in my life is taller than me). 

My “flat” shoes that aren’t pointed toe, are also all chunky or “flatforms”, adding length to my proportions

I have found that moderate-to-conservative cut fitted tops combined with looser bottoms looks AWESOME because it highlights the bust and waist, and looser bottoms help elongate and are also easier to find a correct fit for since you can typically not have to worry about your hip measurement for looser garments. 

Looser dresses are totally an option too! Yet because of my bust I pretty much always highlight the waist with a belt, without this my boobs gape out the fabric and hide my favorite feature (my waist) and overalls just make me feel like a walking event tent 

Tighter garments for spicier outfits also tooootally an option.

Otherwise the trick with wide leg is to have them tailored, i.e., take out some of the excess volume. Pre-skinny era, I had to do this all the time with dress slacks.  

I am also finding that the cropped length for wides works better than full length -- adds some structure back in, when your ankle is exposed.

The post reads as very condescending and I agree with your comment on the tone used in describing dated looks, as well as the point about men not receiving the same tone in messaging. 

“wear whatever you want” includes adding newer trends to your wardrobe, whether they are from very young generations or trending among older women but not among younger. The point is to make choices because you enjoy them and you like the current fashion trends, not because you fear being an old and dated lady who’s not hip with the kids, which is the tone I got from this post. 

I also agree with you on that applying “wear whatever” everywhere is idealistic. Obviously you cannot wear a crop top to the office or job networking, you’d look silly. Same for fancy dinners or meeting partners’ families or whatever event requires more formal styles.

femalefashionadvice,"They specified that low ankle boots were no longer in style - the examples shown after had, as they mentioned, a higher shaft. What’s out of fashion are boots where the shaft falls more around the ankle bone, probably falling more in the 6-8” range for shaft heights (so shorter than mid calf or knee boots). I didn’t spot anything with a clearly short shaft shown otherwise, however they’re certainly still wearable with different cuts of jeans without being clearly dated (ex longer jeans that cover most of the shoe).

I’m also a little baffled by like the revisionist fashion take that doc martens have always been popular, at least in a mainstream sense. Like sure, in 2000-2010 you could still buy doc martens… but they were only really seen in alternative fashion crowds. Beyond that, the boots shown do appear to be more of a platform style rather than the standard 1460 which is for sure a more modern take… though I think there could be a better example. 

Also - the bag shown is an unstructured bag. It’s an unlined tote bag with unfinished edges. Yeah, it’s not a totally shapeless hobo bag - but it’s not what would be called structured. Generally this is reserved for bags that hold their shape fairly well (the classic example is a Birken bag) or more loosely have very structured elements (ex I’ve seen some where the bay was clearly a softer leather, but had very rigid and structured handles). Less structured/big bags have been around a little more… but I’ve seen them with more finished handles/edges mostly. 

🤷‍♀️ also you not liking a silhouette doesn’t meant it isn’t one.  

Also, just as a millennial… I wonder if you are one as well or just are a very different age, because a lot of the looks are pretty typical/spot on examples and I’m 36.

Some people replying to you are saying this means it must be too tight -- but this isn't the case. Postural changes can cause bad pressure (e.g., when sitting the waistband can be pulled against your stomach too much).

I avoid the perfectly-fitting high-waisted jeans on bad stomach days, personally. If it's a casual day, leggings without a constricting top band can be a great choice (I get mine from Aerie).

femalefashionadvice,"&gt;We still see a lot of millennials sporting a long dark wing and overly contoured face though, so not sure what you’re on about there.
&gt;
&gt;To your last point, I have no idea what you’re talking about. Maybe that was just you and your friend group who judged people for updating their styles. 

I didn't mean me and my friends, I'm talking about memes [like this one](https://starecat.com/men-over-30-in-skinny-jeans-bulldog-thin-legs/) that were doing the rounds. I'm not saying nobody over 30 looked good wearing them or that every single person judged them, just that they were often seen as more of a clothing item for younger people and people over 30 weren't often seen as ""out of date"" for sticking with their usual clothes, but rather dressing their age.

&gt;you can either resist it or go with it. People who are more conservative or fearful of change will resist and people who are more open-minded and liberal will welcome change. 

I think this is very much a matter of perspective. I think it's more open minded and liberal to think ""you do you"" and ""wear what makes you happy"", and more conservative to think that it's important to keep up with the Jones / follow trends. That feels less individualistic and more crowd following. Picking clothes to impress others rather than picking what you're drawn to is not very liberal minded to me.

&gt;This is a female fashion advice sub and this post is specifically about millennials updating their skinny jeans.

I know this is what the post is about, but there are a lot of comments wondering why people are clinging to skinnies so naturally people who like skinnies are going to reply to that. 

&gt;Where I’m getting annoyed is people proclaiming they don’t care what people think of them (in their outdated skinny jeans) when literally all of us care what other people think of us. That’s human nature. 

Really? You genuinely care so much what others think that you can't comprehend that people exist who don't? You think everyone who says that is just lying? I really, truly, 100% don't care if someone thinks my jeans are outdated. That strikes me as a petty and judgmental thought to have about another person. I genuinely value a live and let live mentality. You do you. Wear what makes you happy. If you like to be trendy or change up your look - great! If you love the way skinnies look - great! If you hate the way they look - great, don't wear them! People like different things. I don't like the look of some of the pictures here, and therefore won't emulate them in my own wardrobe, but that's my personal preference and if people like them - more power to them. It's not that hard to grasp. 

The only ""human nature"" caring about what people think part is wanting people to see me as a decent person. But I can't care what people think more deeply than that because people aren't a monolith and it's literally impossible to be liked or admired by everyone. What one person loves about me another will hate so I just put my energy into caring about what my loved ones think and what makes me happy. 

&gt; That’s why you’re here looking for advice and tips on your style.

femalefashionadvice,"GenXer here as well, on the older side of the generation. Up until 6th grade, we wore light wash disco bell bottomed high rise jeans, then overnight those went out of fashion and it was mid-rise straight legged or bootcut dark wash jeans (from the GAP) for a long long time until the early 90s. I cannot wear low rises at all (they slip right off my straight hips) so I pretty much stopped wearing jeans in the 2000s. 

I love high rise and find them to be the most comfortable (even though I'm short) and most flattering. And I really like high rise skinny jeans as they suit my figure. But I've always been a sucker for a dramatic flare and have indulged on and off whenever they were a fringe trend. 

So now I have a pair of flares again and .... it's so weird. I know they look great, but I feel weird in them, like ... ""uh, I've been here before."" They may look fresh to the younger set but to my eye somehow they feel dated. 

I would like to add a pair of wide leg jeans but then I consider my 80 year old mom, and that's what she's worn for decades. 

Personally I don't mind the frayed hem trend and hope it sticks around, as it is quite easy to just cut my jeans to the right length for my short self, no tailor required.

I think most of us millennials know we're not 25, and we aren't dressing for Gen Z - we're dressing for our millennial peers and maybe those a bit older than us, too.

To your last point, I have no idea what you’re talking about. Maybe that was just you and your friend group who judged people for updating their styles. I still remember me and my older sister giving my mom a make over and she looked stunning in her skinny jeans and side parted, straightened hair.

My motivation really stems from learning we become solidified in our beliefs by about 25 and it’s very hard for us to deviate from said beliefs. And also that technology (this includes fashion, make up, etc) is always evolving and you can either resist it or go with it. People who are more conservative or fearful of change will resist and people who are more open-minded and liberal will welcome change. 

But where I’ll agree with the onslaught of people who disagree with me is that it’s ultimately your lives, you can do whatever you want. But I’m allowed to criticize just like you’re doing to me. This is a female fashion advice sub and this post is specifically about millennials updating their skinny jeans.

femalefashionadvice,"I'm sorry I just can't go back to what I wore in HS and feel ""modern"". The buffet proportions we wore in the 90s especially just weren't flattering then and aren't now.

I cannot stand the cropped flare or cropped wide leg jean look. I said it. It makes me have flashbacks to being the tall skinny girl with pants that didn't fit bc no one cared about tall girls when I was growing up. I brought capris into style bc I had to wear them and I hated every minute.

Why can't we just wear what we want and wear what's flattering on our bodies and everyone leave us the hell alone about it? Why do I have to care what's trendy or in/out right now? Why is anything ever ""out"" anyway? Shouldn't individually always be ""in""?

I'm 5'9"", 120lbs and 39 yo with a face that says 30-35... No kids so I have no hips so I can't wear mom jeans bc they look like riding pants on me. You know those pants with the pointy hips horseback riders wear? Not cute when it's not intentional. I just.... 🫠 Railcar and Naked &amp; Famous don't make the styles I just bought a few years ago anymore and the new cuts don't fit me ☹️.  

Now I've lost a ton of weight and my jeans don't fit without belts and are wearing out and I desperately need new ones and I'm so lost. I just want a 26/27 waist with a 33/34 inseam in a dark wash that are straight through the hips and ankle or skinny and mid/high waisted. I need dressy jeans again bc my dressy ones are too worn and aren't anymore. And big ol jinco's cut to the ankle or mid-calf just ain't that 🤷🏼‍♀️

femalefashionadvice,"&gt; Maybe I’m just young and stupid, but posts like these always have a flavor of hating on women for aging. Nobody makes these posts about men’s fashion, even if trends among younger men differ significantly from older men.   

I appreciate the effort that OP put into compiling her post, but there was something about the tone that I couldn't get over which was that a lot of her examples of a ""dated"" look were all of a certain type of look on a specific demographic of women when talking about a general style that has been prevalent for over 15 years. Some of this came across to me like ""You're the out-of-touch suburban mom who spends all of her time driving her kids around and is too busy to be *with* it anymore, so here's a guide for you!"" However, a lot of people still wear skinny jeans and it's not like anybody's going outside and pointing out every adult who looks like their clothes are older than 5 years. I'd go so far to even say that if anybody has bought new clothes within the past 5 years, that the cuts would have been already been updated ever to fit the new trends so if you buy skinny jeans now, but even a ""mid-rise"" is gonna be an inch higher than before and it's going to be looser through the ankle. That all being said, I do think there's a prevalent bias in society where men are allowed to age (because maturity is a valued trait in men since it is equated with stability and power) whereas youth is valued in women.    

I feel like for women, there's this awkward period between young (20s-30s) and old (60s+) where you feel like you have to look younger because you're still judged by your appearance but haven't gotten to the point where you can look ""distinguished"" and be respected for your age. A cool, oversized slouchy outfit on a 20-yo looks like an intentional statement while the same thing on a 40-yo looks slovenly and lazy because regardless of what you wear, people can still tell your age and the expectations for different ages are... different. When you're young, you really only have to worry about fitting in with your age group because any negative comments from older people can be explained with your youth. However, once you hit your 30s - people expect more out of you cause you're an *adult*, you end up in this weird spot of needing to not look ""old"" while also be put together enough so you command the respect for your age. I also think that as you get older, you don't care to suffer minor inconveniences for fashion like you can when you're younger, so the motivations also change. I hated the flapping sound of flares as I walked and constantly adjusting spaghetti strap shirts cause those straps could not stay on my shoulders the first time around, and those are just not things that I feel the need to reintroduce into my wardrobe.  

Anyway, should we not *care* about how people perceive us and just wear what we like? Sure, that sounds great and again... it works better in practice when you're young and have nothing to lose and nobody who relies on you. It's harder to practice when you're employed in a senior or management position that calls for a certain amount of professionalism (general statement that doesn't apply to everybody like those in the creative fields) or when you're at an event for your kid and have to show other parents and teachers that you're a responsible adult who has a 401k and buys organic fruit. I remember my manager at my first job talking to me about dressing more modestly and feeling the need to tone down my style after that (I was fully clothed but doing the exposed strappy bandeau thing that was popular at the time). This was probably 10 years ago and while that kind of talk may get some backlash now, those people are still working in industry and in high-level positions which affect you and how you're perceived and your career trajectory.",maybe i m just young and stupid but post like these always have a flavor of hating on woman for aging nobody make these post about men s fashion even if trend among younger men differ significantly from older men i appreciate the effort that op put into compiling her post but there wa something about the tone that i couldn t get over which wa that a lot of her example of a dated look were all of a certain type of look on a specific demographic of woman when talking about a general style that ha been prevalent for over 15 year some of this came across to me like you re the out of touch suburban mom who spends all of her time driving her kid around and is too busy to be with it anymore so here s a guide for you however a lot of people still wear skinny jean and it s not like anybody s going outside and pointing out every adult who look like their clothes are older than 5 year i d go so far to even say that if anybody ha bought new clothes within the past 5 year that the cut would have been already been updated ever to fit the new trend so if you buy skinny jean now but even a mid rise is gonna be an inch higher than before and it s going to be looser through the ankle that all being said i do think there s a prevalent bias in society where men are allowed to age because maturity is a valued trait in men since it is equated with stability and power whereas youth is valued in woman i feel like for woman there s this awkward period between young 20 30 and old 60 where you feel like you have to look younger because you re still judged by your appearance but haven t gotten to the point where you can look distinguished and be respected for your age a cool oversized slouchy outfit on a 20 yo look like an intentional statement while the same thing on a 40 yo look slovenly and lazy because regardless of what you wear people can still tell your age and the expectation for different age different when you re young you really only have to worry about fitting in with your age group because any negative comment from older people can be explained with your youth however once you hit your 30 people expect more out of you cause you re an adult you end up in this weird spot of needing to not look old while also be put together enough so you command the respect for your age i also think that a you get older you don t care to suffer minor inconvenience for fashion like you can when you re younger so the motivation also change i hated the flapping sound of flare a i walked and constantly adjusting spaghetti strap shirt cause those strap could not stay on my shoulder the first time around and those are just not thing that i feel the need to reintroduce into my wardrobe anyway should we not care about how people perceive u and just wear what we like sure that sound great and it work better in practice when you re young and have nothing to lose and nobody who relies on you it s harder to practice when you re employed in a senior or management position that call for a certain amount of professionalism general statement that doesn t apply to everybody like those in the creative field or when you re at an event for your kid and have to show other parent and teacher that you re a responsible adult who ha a 401k and buy organic fruit i remember my manager at my first job talking to me about dressing more modestly and feeling the need to tone down my style after that i wa fully clothed but doing the exposed strappy bandeau thing that wa popular at the time this wa probably 10 year ago and while that kind of talk may get some backlash now those people are still working in industry and in high level position which affect you and how you re perceived and your career trajectory,726,0

femalefashionadvice,"Okay, here’s a quick tip from me to whoever is reading: being trendy is not the same as being stylish. If you feel attacked by this post and yet can’t fathom wearing some of the suggested products you’ve been told might possibly convince someone you’re not old (???), stick with what suits you, because suddenly switching out your beloved skinnies for flared denim isn’t going to convince anyone you’re a teenager again. You’re still a regular mom, not a cool mom.

It’s not unreasonable to criticize that someone’s magnum opus isn’t quite hitting the mark. And the whole “Well, then you do it” is such a childish retort. I have yet to write the great American novel, but I can still tell you that Nicholas Sparks writes the same maudlin cliches in every novel.

femalefashionadvice,"As a nasty old millennial with cheugy skinnies, I appreciate this reply.

I haven't jumped on many of these new trends because they simply don't flatter me. Boxy blazers overwhelm my trim shape. ""Voluminous"" tops make my already wide shoulders look like a linebacker's. Boxy shoes shorten my already short legs. The godforsaken slouchy, oversized jeans trend... honestly, who are those supposed to flatter??? I cannot tell you how many of these I tried on before giving up. I found ONE pair of cropped, straight leg pants that I'd give a B+. I barely wear them. All the time I spent trying to keep up with this trend that's just ugly on me I could've spent doing literally anything else with my apparently dwindling years.

I generally love putting time into my personal style. I get compliments daily on my outfits from colleagues and the college students I engage with (and no, we don't live in a cheugy town but a major US city, so we have access to the latest trends) so I must be doing something right despite my blatant violations of this post's advice. I wear a lot of vintage, pointy-toe flats, cropped pants, Uniqlo, and *gasp* skinny jeans. With every flipping fashion trend, I take what I like and trash the rest. Lately it's been 

* High-waisted (but only 12-inch+ rises for my long torso, which are hard to find and kept me off this trend for a long time)

* Color! Lots of good color out now, especially mustard and rust. I'm done with the beige 20-teens

* Cream pants. I've always wanted these and now I have 2 pairs and would buy a third (lol per the above point against beige, I do wear them with colorful tops)

* lol is this it? It actually is. Looking in my closet, I see how few of the current trends I've adopted because they simply don't work for me.

Fashion wanes. Style is timeless. For anyone who feels the need to rewrite your look or story per the trends: Reclaim your time. If you feel good with how you look, lovely. If you don't, there are a lot of factors (mental and physical health, changing body, aging, life transitions, gender changes, new disability, etc.) that might be at play, and some wide-leg trousers aren't necessarily going to cure you.

femalefashionadvice,"Pretty much anything goes in Vegas but it also very much depends on your itinerary. Are you going to nice shops/restaurants/casinos/shows? The sandals may be a bit unseasonable but maybe some nicer shoes than the sneakers - a nice boot or flat shoe would dress up either leggings or slim jeans. Ditto the tops - bring your favorite nice tops and a cardigan or two to pair with on chilly nights. You may even want a lightweight jacket if you definitely don't want to get chilled.

femalefashionadvice,"I honestly don’t like this post. I might be reading wayyy too deep into it, but, this has a very weird flavor of ageism. People are not “cheugy” (I have literally never heard anymore use this word outside of the Internet) or otherwise unattractive and uncool for wearing skinny jeans and a side part. 

I’m 21. Wear whatever you want. The “young people” making the trends literally do not care if you have the 2023 equivalent of a perm. To be bluntly honest (I genuinely do not intend to insult anyone): a 20 year old can tell you are not 20 if you are 40. They don’t expect you to adhere to trends set by people in their twenties. They expect you to dress differently and don’t think anything of it if you do. I realize there’s a lot of Gen Z on the Internet making fun of millennials, but the Internet is a cesspool of negativity and hate for a lot of things. 

I wear skinny jeans to class a lot because I look terrible in mom jeans or straight leg jeans. I’m short with big thighs and a square waist; they are not flattering on my body type. Dress in what makes you feel happy and confident. 

Maybe I’m just young and stupid, but posts like these always have a flavor of hating on women for aging. Nobody makes these posts about men’s fashion, even if trends among younger men differ significantly from older men. It’s always women that are the target of stuff like this, because despite it being 2023 we don’t let women age for some reason. We instead encourage women to wear clothes they don’t like, get surgical procedures, buy expensive anti-aging skincare, etc. Maybe my thoughts will change when I am older, but I really do think it’s harmful to perpetuate a belief that women need to reverse their aging to be beautiful. The wisdom and knowledge and experience that come with aging is something I admire greatly in my family and mentors. I wish we allowed the external results of that experience to be reflected without judgment and a need for change.",i honestly don t like this post i might be reading wayyy too deep into it but this ha a very weird flavor of ageism people are not cheugy i have literally never heard anymore use this word outside of the internet or otherwise unattractive and uncool for wearing skinny jean and a side part i m 21 wear whatever you want the young people making the trend literally do not care if you have the 2023 equivalent of a perm to be bluntly honest i genuinely do not intend to insult anyone a 20 year old can tell you are not 20 if you are 40 they don t expect you to adhere to trend set by people in their twenty they expect you to dress differently and don t think anything of it if you do i realize there s a lot of gen z on the internet making fun of millennials but the internet is a cesspool of negativity and hate for a lot of thing i wear skinny jean to class a lot because i look terrible in mom jean or straight leg jean i m short with big thigh and a square waist they are not flattering on my body type dress in what make you feel happy and confident maybe i m just young and stupid but post like these always have a flavor of hating on woman for aging nobody make these post about men s fashion even if trend among younger men differ significantly from older men it s always woman that are the target of stuff like this because despite it being 2023 we don t let woman age for some reason we instead encourage woman to wear clothes they don t like get surgical procedure buy expensive anti aging skincare etc maybe my thought will change when i am older but i really do think it s harmful to perpetuate a belief that woman need to reverse their aging to be beautiful the wisdom and knowledge and experience that come with aging is something i admire greatly in my family and mentor i wish we allowed the external result of that experience to be reflected without judgment and a need for change,372,0

femalefashionadvice,"Okay, I get it, fashion is cyclical and that’s what keeps it fresh and interesting. But these Gen Z kids WERE NOT THERE for the early 90’s when the ONLY pants you could find were unflattering Mom Jeans or JNCOs.

When skinny jeans became a trend and widely available I was STOKED. Finally, a look that I like! And the stretchy fabric! Amazing. No one will ever be able to tell me that a tapered leg hitting at the ankle and a saggy butt is a better shape than skinny jeans.

And yes, I have literally used the “cold dead hands” phrase. Like, multiple times in the last 6 months.

IMO most “crafty” jewelry is not really trendy right now, with the exception of very summery  and youthful items like friendship type bracelets and beaded chokers with flower beads. But tiny beaded shapes, wire wrapped beads, dichroic glass, and polymer clay look kind of dated.

femalefashionadvice,"Please recommend me the perfect white shirts (or pants) that I can bleach or oxiclean back to crisp whiteness (without additional soaking). I stain my clothes even though I’m super careful. I’m tired of using specific stain removers (I have Oxiclean, Oxiclean spray, Tide spray, Tide pen) and soaking my clothes in those stain removers for up to days and the stain not coming off. I understand you need to know what kind of stain it was to know which stain remover to use, but sometimes my clothes stain and I don’t know what stained them. 

I want to be the person who wears white shirts around the house and while eating. 

I like linen but sometimes they’re a bit see through so prefer cotton or something with a tighter weave. I like form fitting stretchy fabrics. Linen is also rather pricey for me, and I prefer cotton-linen blends to plain linen since linen wrinkles so easily. 

I don’t want to wear all black everything just to avoid stains. I like some black, not all black, and not around the house.

femalefashionadvice,"The trick to having style is finding, over time, which trends are *you,* which bits and pieces of each passing look you feel drawn to and want to save. 

You only look really dated if you're wearing a whole outfit in a way that was very trendy about ten years back. Wearing only trendy clothes to begin with is how you end up looking dated, because being completely on trend requires new clothing every season or two. So what happens is a lot of women only follow the trends, don't put much thought into them, then in their 30s they realize they haven't been shopping in years and their whole wardrobe is hopelessly dated. 

But that's avoidable if, from the beginning, you're taking a critical look at the trends and how you really like them as they come and go, so that you can assemble your personal style. Keep the things/trends you like, like long cardigans, and eventually you'll find you have a wardrobe that's uniquely you and never quite out of style, but also never quite fully on trend, because it's yours. At that point, you can just play with whatever trends you want, and ignore those you don't.",the trick to having style is finding over time which trend are you which bit and piece of each passing look you feel drawn to and want to save you only look really dated if you re wearing a whole outfit in a way that wa very trendy about ten year back wearing only trendy clothes to begin with is how you end up looking dated because being completely on trend requires new clothing every season or two so what happens is a lot of woman only follow the trend don t put much thought into them then in their 30 they realize they haven t been shopping in year and their whole wardrobe is hopelessly dated but that s avoidable if from the beginning you re taking a critical look at the trend and how you really like them a they come and go so that you can assemble your personal style keep the thing trend you like like long cardigan and eventually you ll find you have a wardrobe that s uniquely you and never quite out of style but also never quite fully on trend because it s yours at that point you can just play with whatever trend you want and ignore those you don t,210,0

The mid 90s was dominated by bootcut jeans, but flares also gained popularity. I wore literally all of the above, except baggy jeans. I even had a rare pair of skinny jeans that were a throwback to late 70s/early 80s punk style which I wore with Docs. The 2000s were all about the low rise flares, which I loved, until skinny jeans came on the scene - of which I was an early enthusiastic adopter. I literally bought my first pair of skinnies and put all my flares away.   
Now I'm old, and I'm having trouble adopting new styles, but I'm definitely tired of skinny jeans. I think the problem for me is that I'm very short and bigger than I used to be, so all the new jean silhouettes make me look shapeless. 

One thing I noticed about the dated photos you shared vs the new ones is that the older ones do look, cuter and more put together to my eye, but they also read as ""basic"". The new photos look more contemporary, but there's almost an anti-fashion sensibility with the frayed hems and boxy silhouettes that I think look ok in the photos pictured but on an older, chubbier person just reads as sloppy and unkempt. Last fall I went out to do some errands in a new pair of mom jeans that I bought pre-frayed, and I was treated poorly by retail staff at a couple different places. I even got free food from a bakery, where I guess I was mistaken for a very poor or homeless person???",great post i d love to see more i d also like to discus some of the topic you raise first off i m gen x not millennial so i went through many many jean silhouette before this in the early 90 we mostly wore a basic mom jean seinfeld style we also wore painter jean super wide leg house jean and low riding baggy style hip hop jean the mid 90 wa dominated by bootcut jean but flare also gained popularity i wore literally all of the above except baggy jean i even had a rare pair of skinny jean that were a throwback to late 70 early 80 punk style which i wore with doc the 2000s were all about the low rise flare which i loved until skinny jean came on the scene of which i wa an early enthusiastic adopter i literally bought my first pair of skinny and put all my flare away now i m old and i m having trouble adopting new style but i m definitely tired of skinny jean i think the problem for me is that i m very short and bigger than i used to be so all the new jean silhouette make me look shapeless one thing i noticed about the dated photo you shared v the new one is that the older one do look cuter and more put together to my eye but they also read a basic the new photo look more contemporary but there s almost an anti fashion sensibility with the frayed hem and boxy silhouette that i think look ok in the photo pictured but on an older chubbier person just read a sloppy and unkempt last fall i went out to do some errand in a new pair of mom jean that i bought pre frayed and i wa treated poorly by retail staff at a couple different place i even got free food from a bakery where i guess i wa mistaken for a very poor or homeless person,339,0

All the sudden EVERYTHING was new, and I was completely overwhelmed about where to even start. I’ve recently been researching different elements of modern style (imagine, I have to RESEARCH modern style 😬 . Gasp.) Here it all is so clear and laid out plainly. A full guide. I was so confused about ankle boots and am SO relieved to finally know. 

I have a vintage light purple long and boxy sweater that I put out to be donated, and I’m going to take it out and try a front tuck. I still have not successfully found a pair of jeans. I am living Jean-less as I refuse to wear skinny jeans and be outdated. I’m experimenting with leggings looks and will be relieved to move into shorts weather. Shorts are so predictable.

You elucidated all the elements that are confusing, and I feel I have a precise guide to the modern silhouette. I also couldn’t articulate before that the changing silhouette is what has changed everything around and made everything need to be redone.

You even explained the thin cardigan that’s sitting in my closet that I’m now CERTAIN needs to be donated.

femalefashionadvice,"Ooh wow what a great post!  I've actually been thinking about my skinny jeans a lot and making a post that was sort of in defense of skinny jeans but also looking for tips in keeping them updated through styling and I think you touched on a lot of great things here.  

I think a key take away when wearing a more cropped or ankle length skinny is to only do so when you're a wearing a sandal or strappy heeled shoe that exposes a lot of foot otherwise it can look awkward.  Or you can always just cover the bottom of the jeans with a chunky boot,  problem solved.

The only thing I will push back on from the ""don't do this"" section is #1.  I think a lot of people would say those outfits could be ""fixed"" by wearing a high-rise skinny instead.  But as a woman in her 30's living in a post pandemic world I am done wearing clothes that aren't completely comfortable and high rise skinnies that is you.  I have a pair that I'll pull out for a special occasion in the evening but a full day getting my stomach squeezed non-stop is just too much!  While the tuck into the mid-rise can create a long torso effect, you can't tell me the boxy cardigan is doing the torso any favors either.

Personally I'm not on a journey to look trendy.  That's an never-ending treadmill that I don't have the time, money, or energy for.  I think we'll look back on looks like the volumious top example and wonder what we were thinking.  Most millennials at this point have developed a sense of their personal style and what works for them.  So my advise to everyone is to forget what is trendy but on what is classic and what fits you and your life style.

Lastly I'd like to talk about the two reasons why of all the fashions we grew up with we are still hanging on to skinnies?  FirstlLike I already mentioned comfort is a big part of it.  Skinnies have more elastin then any other jean and that makes them softer.  Many of these other styles require a more strachy and stiff material and frankly I don't want that touching my skin.  Second they are flattering.  They aren't changing the shape of your leg or your proportions.  While not everyone is completely proportional working against your proportions is often a losing battle and embracing your natural shape is often most flattering.",ooh wow what a great post i ve actually been thinking about my skinny jean a lot and making a post that wa sort of in defense of skinny jean but also looking for tip in keeping them updated through styling and i think you touched on a lot of great thing here i think a key take away when wearing a more cropped or ankle length skinny is to only do so when you re a wearing a sandal or strappy heeled shoe that expose a lot of foot otherwise it can look awkward or you can always just cover the bottom of the jean with a chunky boot problem solved the only thing i will push back on from the don t do this section is 1 i think a lot of people would say those outfit could be fixed by wearing a high rise skinny instead but a a woman in her 30 s living in a post pandemic world i am done wearing clothes that aren t completely comfortable and high rise skinny that is you i have a pair that i ll pull out for a special occasion in the evening but a full day getting my stomach squeezed non stop is just too much while the tuck into the mid rise can create a long torso effect you can t tell me the boxy cardigan is doing the torso any favor either personally i m not on a journey to look trendy that s an never ending treadmill that i don t have the time money or energy for i think we ll look back on look like the volumious top example and wonder what we were thinking most millennials at this point have developed a sense of their personal style and what work for them so my advise to everyone is to forget what is trendy but on what is classic and what fit you and your life style lastly i d like to talk about the two reason why of all the fashion we grew up with we are still hanging on to skinny firstllike i already mentioned comfort is a big part of it skinny have more elastin then any other jean and that make them softer many of these other style require a more strachy and stiff material and frankly i don t want that touching my skin second they are flattering they aren t changing the shape of your leg or your proportion while not everyone is completely proportional working against your proportion is often a losing battle and embracing your natural shape is often most flattering,438,0

femalefashionadvice,"fashion isn't the same thing as getting made fun of for a hobby though. Fashion is on your body. The body isn't neutral, as much as we might wish it was.

femalefashionadvice,"Thank you, a well-written and inspiring post.

One thing I don't understand about high-waisted pants: Are they really supposed to fit at a natural waist?

I have a long torso and naturally prefer a higher rise. All my skinnies always have been ""high rise"". Which means fitting just under my belly button.  
More modern high rise (mom jeans etc.) fits at my belly button (which is still good three inches under my natural waist), and it looks better, I think. I also have ultra high rise cargos that fit a little bit above the belly button. Then I have flare jeans that go even higher but so high waist doesn't look balanced to me anymore, there is a too big block of fabric between the crotch and the waistline.  
I do like skirts that fit at the actual natural waist but I think they are different because they hide the crotch and basically correct the long torso thing.

Models in online shops never have supposedly high-waisted pants at their natural waist. Always somewhere around the belly button.",thank you a well written and inspiring post one thing i don t understand about high waisted pant are they really supposed to fit at a natural waist i have a long torso and naturally prefer a higher rise all my skinny always have been high rise which mean fitting just under my belly button more modern high rise mom jean fit at my belly button which is still good three inch under my natural waist and it look better i think i also have ultra high rise cargo that fit a little bit above the belly button then i have flare jean that go even higher but so high waist doesn t look balanced to me anymore there is a too big block of fabric between the crotch and the waistline i do like skirt that fit at the actual natural waist but i think they are different because they hide the crotch and basically correct the long torso thing model in online shop never have supposedly high waisted pant at their natural waist always somewhere around the belly button,181,0

And then you have to also spend time actually trying stuff on to figure out what works for you personally or not.

[One -](https://imgur.com/a/0LAEaCG) Included the inspo where I saw this tan red combo and absolutely loved it. Red has been something that’s been huge and I’ve been enjoying, so pulled back out this red turtleneck to wear with everything.

Did a ton of walking but was sad to see the wear to my silk socks at the end of the day. Top is a shoulder padded tank which is a easy throw on. 

[Five -](https://imgur.com/a/FQQxJ42) Easy weekend throw on. 

[Six -](https://imgur.com/a/NHjmH3p) Playing with this white can really be the strong “color” contrast sometimes vs a true neutral. Wish I had picked just the shoes or just the bag, but it was raining and the shoes were for practicality. 

[Seven -](https://imgur.com/a/QWFwSjH) I love yellow. This shirt has a kind of weird kind of cool sculpted sleeve. It’s huge. 

[Eight -](https://imgur.com/a/kcPp3dg) And last off, some variations on a theme from a very versatile skirt. For daytime, I picked the loafers and wore it up as a knee length dress with a monochrome shirt underneath(took off the lumpy lacy bra underneath for a better look). Then for evening, my so and I went to another Michelin restaurant, so I took the opportunity to pull it down as the skirt and pull out my cream heels. I love these shoes and don’t have much chance to wear them, even if they make me slow walking from the subway.

femalefashionadvice,"Hey there! I was hoping to get some advice in finding activewear bottoms that aren't leggings (or tight fitting in general). I may be looking in the wrong places or have the wrong keywords haha, but been having really poor luck in finding nice pants to work out in. 

The closest options to what I like are the Nike dri-fit running pants/shorts which feel and look great (though rip my wallet, and the clothes' durability since I wear the same pair all the time.) 

Are there any brands that do the women's equivalent to men's gym shorts? Or perhaps something similar to Nike's dri fit bottoms?",hey there i wa hoping to get some advice in finding activewear bottom that aren t legging or tight fitting in general i may be looking in the wrong place or have the wrong keywords haha but been having really poor luck in finding nice pant to work out in the closest option to what i like are the nike dri fit running pant short which feel and look great though rip my wallet and the clothes durability since i wear the same pair all the are there any brand that do the woman s equivalent to men s gym short or perhaps something similar to nike s dri fit bottom,111,0
femalefashionadvice,"What did ponte pants do to you lol - let people live, girl! Fashion isn’t always a performance for your personal taste. 

On a similar note, if I choose to wear a linen sack dress it’s because I specifically want to wear my linen sack dress and that *is* both the intention and the execution. I’m not getting dressed thinking “oh, god forbid someone thinks I’m trying too hard or not enough, better put on my pointless fail proof sack”",what did ponte pant do to you lol let people live girl fashion isn t always a performance for your personal taste on a similar note if i choose to wear a linen sack dress it s because i specifically want to wear my linen sack dress and that is both the intention and the execution i m not getting dressed thinking oh god forbid someone think i m trying too hard or not enough better put on my pointless fail proof sack,83,0
